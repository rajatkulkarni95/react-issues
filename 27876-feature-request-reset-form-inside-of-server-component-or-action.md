## Description

Hi, I want to be able to reset my form easily (after the action succeeded (so with the ability to react to a response of the server))  with JS Disabled and JS Enabled (if this is even possible).

The response of the server reaction thingy should be something like this:

-> On Success: The form should clear itself
-> On Error: The input should keep it's content
