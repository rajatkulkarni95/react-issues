## Description

`react-devtools-core` has `ws` as a dependency and in release 8.17.1 `ws` have issued a fix to a DoS vulnerability ([link](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/8.17.1)). Would it be possible to upgrade to use this version of `ws`?

(Apologies if I have filed this in the incorrect place, but I was unclear on where these issues should be raised.)

React version: React DevTools 5.3.0
