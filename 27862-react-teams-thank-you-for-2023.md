## Description

It's been a long time ([2017!](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11940)) since we've done this, but we're reviving the tradition! The community has grown so much since then; [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactjs) had about 64k tagged React questions, [/r/reactjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs) had about 30k members, and [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com) about 25k members. Wild to see today that there are now 472k questions on Stack Overflow, the subreddit is at 373k subscribers, and Reactiflux at 224k members. 10x over 6 years, and the downloads on npm don't even _slightly_ compare.

The list of industry-changing projects that serve or were inspired by React is too long to list. We even have a [feature-length documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44) of its origins now!

This year brought us a lot of great changes: A new docs site, increasing community ownership of React through a more distributed core team ‚Äî shoutout in particular to Sebastian Markb√•ge, now at Vercel, and Dan Abramov, now at BlueSky ‚Äî and of course, Server Components. Shoutout to Expo, Remix, Next, to the countless UI toolkits, state-management tools, and testing aids, the legions of components and hooks. 

2023 has been a rough year for tech, and neither the core team nor the ecosystem has been immune: our thoughts are with those who have been laid off, both on React teams and more widely. 

Thank you for all that you do. Here's to 2024 ü•Ç To other devs reading this, I invite you to reply with your own ‚Äúthank you‚Äùs; let‚Äôs show them how grateful we are! Share a story of when you interacted with someone from the team, how React has touched your life, or just express your thanks üòÑ
