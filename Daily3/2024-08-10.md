### [React 19] Internal secrets causing issue with SSR in dev mode

> Issue #31949 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31949)

In React 19, the internal secret variable was renamed to `_DO_NOT_USE_OR_WARN_USERS_THEY_CANNOT_UPGRADE`. 
My first question is, why does it need to be prefixed with `__CLIENT_INTERNALS` and `__SERVER_INTERNALS`? 
This causes an issue with my precompiled component library. I don't give those components `"use client"` directive because it's an icon library that doesn't need any hook. So, NextJS rendered them on server and this happened

I inspected the code of my icon library and found this
```js
import y3 from "react";
...

...
    function O() {
      var e = v.A;
      return e === null ? null : e.getOwner();
    }
...
    var f3 = y3, ... v = f3.__CLIENT_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_WARN_USERS_THEY_CANNOT_UPGRADE, ...
...
```

I noticed the internal secret is named `__SERVER_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_WARN_USERS_THEY_CANNOT_UPGRADE` on server.
![server internals](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27a28cad-e35d-4a6a-b5f6-a03c5a6d1f20)

The error was solved when I manually changed the code.
```js
...
    var f3 = y3, ... v = f3.__SERVER_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_WARN_USERS_THEY_CANNOT_UPGRADE, ...
...
```

My last question, is there any way to make the compiled code to use server secret if the client secret is not available and vice-versa? I don't want to manually edit the code after compiling them whenever I add new icons in future

Thank you!

PS. The error only happens when I run `npm run dev`.

### Bug: Uncaught ReferenceError: MessageChannel is not defined

> Issue #31827 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31827)

React version: 19.0.0

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Create an Astro & React project with server adapter for Cloudflare
2. Try to deploy to Cloudflare Pages via `wrangler deploy`

## The current behavior
Uncaught ReferenceError: MessageChannel is not defined

## The expected behavior
Should work in the same way as latest 18 version.

### Bug: useOptimistic

> Issue #31708 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31708)

React version:19.0.0
[I got example from react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic) slightly modified it.
 
Now `key` attribute derive value from data (message)
```
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.text}
          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}
        </div>
```

## Steps To Reproduce

1.[Open link](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-dev-forked-5hddwt)
2.Send new message
3.Open console

## The current behavior
On the image below we can see duplicating list of messages from [I got example from react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4868e7d0-7eb1-4e29-ac11-eff9047982f7)

There was no error in [I got example from react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic) because `key` gets values from `index`, `index` is always unique.

        <div key={index}>
          {message.text}
          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}
        </div>

Code that is slightly modified by me print out following (from console):

> Encountered two children with the same key, `8908d3a9-13b7-4576-bf85-e850f7ab2c1c`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version

I don't know the reason of that behaviour but I see that `updateFn` in `useOptimistic` is called with `new message` twice:
1. First time after `addOptimisticMessage` is called, 
2. Second time while `Thread` component is re-rendered.
