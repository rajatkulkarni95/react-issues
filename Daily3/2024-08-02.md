### Repro steps

Hello,

I have installed and setup `eslint-plugin-react-compiler`.

Given the following code:
```tsx
import api from `@shared/api`
export default function JobsPage() {
  const { data, status, refetch } = api.get("/hello").useQuery()
                                 // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ - `Hooks must be the same function on every render, but this value may change over time to a different function`
}
```
 `eslint-plugin-react-compiler` will report the error `Hooks must be the same function on every render` 
The error is correct, but I still don't see anything really wrong with that code. 

Can you please take a look and see if this case here is a false positive? 
Should this code be treated as OK?
If not, do you have a suggestion of what could be done as an alternative?


#### What version of `eslint-plugin-react-compiler` are you using?

`19.0.0-beta-0dec889-20241115`

### Bug: Definition for rule 'react-hooks/exhaustive-deps' was not found

> Issue #31458 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31458)

Hi! 
I just migrated to the new eslint flat config file and I am getting the following error when I want to omit the
 `react-hooks/exhaustived-deps` rule:
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20930ec2-ecff-4ac5-8727-02c1607f1158)


React version: "^18.3.1"

## Steps To Reproduce
I created a reproduction environment starting from the `vite-react` template provided by stackblitz and convertit to webpack. 
‚ùóWhen using vite, this error doesn't appear. 
If you remove the comment `// eslint-disable-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` and run `npm run lint` you will get in the terminal the warning provided by eslint to add a dependency to the useLayoutEffect array. 
When I have the comment, the `npm run lint` run wihtout warnings or errors.
https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-egb7ki?file=src%2FApp.jsx

## The current behavior
Definition for rule 'react-hooks/exhaustive-deps' was not found

## The expected behavior
To be able to omit 'react-hooks/exhaustive-deps' when I need to.

Thanks!
