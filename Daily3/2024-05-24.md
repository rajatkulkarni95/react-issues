### Bug: react-hooks/exhaustive-deps false positive

> Issue #31210 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31210)

Linter seems to be incorrectly "complaining" about a missing dependency whenever calling a method from an object, the snippet below doesn't make sense by itself but trying to come with a minimal example in order to quickly explain the problem.

If I update to `result.refetch` instead of `result.refetch()` it would work, but that would obviously be completely different. The linter seems to properly interpret the dependency without raising any warning/error if not invoking the method

React version: ^18

## The current behavior

React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'result'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.eslint[react-hooks/exhaustive-deps](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14920)

## The expected behavior

There should be no warning as the dependency is passed in the dependencies array
