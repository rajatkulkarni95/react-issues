### Repro steps

The playground link is a **very** simplified example of a form using the [react-hook-form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) library. The component is supposed to output the live value of the input in a div, by calling the [watch](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform/watch) function during render (this function returns the updated form values).  

This doesn't work after the compiler kicks in because it only **calls** the watch function if its **reference** changes, which is not the case. react-hook-form guarantees stability of this function accross renders. The relevant part of the compiled code is

```
 if ($[6] !== watch) {
    t4 = JSON.stringify(watch());
    $[6] = watch;
    $[7] = t4;
  } else {
    t4 = $[7];
  }
```

Is this an issue, or is it something that we should work-around in user land?

Thanks,
David
