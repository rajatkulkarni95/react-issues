**Title**: Inquiry About React 19 Support for ReactPress

**Body**:

Hello ReactPress Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently evaluating [ReactPress](https://github.com/fecommunity/reactpress) for a project and have a question regarding its compatibility with future versions of React. Specifically, I would like to know if there are any plans or ongoing efforts to ensure that ReactPress supports React 19.

React 19 introduces several new features and improvements that could potentially benefit ReactPress. As such, I am keen to understand if the team is already working on integrating these changes or if there are any known issues that might prevent ReactPress from running smoothly on React 19.

Here are a few specific questions I have:

1. Is ReactPress currently compatible with React 19?
2. If not, are there any plans to update ReactPress to support React 19 in the future?
3. Are there any known issues or limitations that users should be aware of if they try to use ReactPress with React 19?

I appreciate your time and effort in maintaining this wonderful project. Thank you for any information you can provide regarding this matter.

Best regards,

fecommunity
