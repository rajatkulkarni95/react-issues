I have class parent component `<A/>`. Which has functional child component `<B/>` which has useEffect. Why i see 'Parent did mount' console first ?

```
const Child = (props) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Child did mount");
  }, []);

  return <input type="text" id="searchInput" />;
};

class Parent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Parent did mount");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Child />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

React version: 16.14.0

## The current behavior
Parent's componentDidMount runs first than Child's.

## The expected behavior
Child's componentDidMount runs first than Parent's.
