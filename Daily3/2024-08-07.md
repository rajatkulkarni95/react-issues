### Bug: Both optimisticValue and new state is displayed together using useOptimistic

> Issue #31943 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31943)

Using the react Example given for useOptimistic hook in docs, an update in state passed to the hook should directly reset the optimisticState in one render.
Instead
1. It calls the updaterFn first, updates the optimisticState using new state and optimisticValue during one render cycle
2. resets optimisticState with new State in another render cycle.

As a result, both the new state and optimisticValue is rendered. Tried this in 20x slowdown

React version: 19

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Throttle CPU to 20x slowdown
2. Type some input in text box and press submit
3. See that the optimistic state is displayed and then it is pushed down for an instant along with the new state
4. Check console logs

## The current behavior

When new state is passed to useOptimistic, 
1. It updates optimisticState by calling updaterFn with new state and optimisticValue
2. Component is rendered using this optimisticState (incorrect one)
3. Another update to optimisticState is done by resetting it to the new state
4. Component is rendered using this new optimisticState (correct one)

## The expected behavior

When new state is passed to useOptimistic, it should directly reset the optimisticState without calling the updater Fn

### [React 19] React.ReactElement with cloneElement - No overload matches this call.

> Issue #31824 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31824)

As far as I know, `React.ReactElement` changed from `any` to `unknown` in React 19. I worked for most of the year with canary versions of Next and React where everything was typed correctly, but it seems that the type change was a more recent addition?

```
    "next": "^15.1.0",
    "react": "^19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0",
    "@types/react": "^19.0.1",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19.0.2",
```

My case: After upgrading my application to the most recent versions, I get type errors for `React.ReactElement` used in React's `cloneElement` method. So I have a type which defines an element:

```
type Item = {
  icon: React.ReactElement;
};
```

And I use it in `cloneElement` where I also provide a `className`:

```
{cloneElement(navItem.icon, {
  className: "h-5 w-5",
})}
```

Here I get the type error: `No overload matches this call. Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'className' does not exist in type 'Partial<unknown> & Attributes'.`

So if I remove the `className` everything works fine.

```
{cloneElement(navItem.icon)}
```

I tried using `React.ReactNode` and `isValidElement` as guard, but it led me to the same type error. How would I solve this in React 19?

Not sure if it is related to this issue: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31357
