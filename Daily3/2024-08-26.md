> Issue #31977 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31977)

### Website or app

localhost

### Repro steps

I'm experiencing an issue with React DevTools while debugging a project locally. Here are the steps to reproduce the issue:

1. Open React DevTools and navigate to the Profiler tab.
2. Start a recording by clicking on "Start Profiling," then stop it by clicking on "Stop Profiling."
3. View the recording results without any issues.
4. Attempt to start a new recording by clicking on "Start Profiling" again.
5. After a few moments, the Profiler becomes extremely slow or completely unresponsive.
6. At this point, I am unable to make additional recordings or refresh the Profiler data.

I hope these details help in identifying and resolving the issue. Let me know if you need further information or clarification.

  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.

Hi, I tried to write tests with Node.js test runner with `jsdom` but this is not working.

Initial render and mount works fine.

But when event is dispatched (click for example) there is no re-render of component.

React version: 18.3.1

#### Guides I used

- https://nodejs.org/en/learn/test-runner/using-test-runner

## Steps To Reproduce

0. Have Node.js 20+ 
1. Clone repository https://github.com/krutoo/node-test-runner-react-dom
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run test`

<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.

Link to code example: https://github.com/krutoo/node-test-runner-react-dom

<!--
  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a
  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the
  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is
  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal
  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
-->

## The current behavior

There is no re-render of component after event is dispatched and as result test is failed

## The expected behavior

Test is done successfully

### [React 19] Can't use debounce for useCallback -  Expected the first argument to be an inline function expressioneslint(react-compiler/react-compiler)

I use debounce functoin for fetching api on each input typing, react-compiler eslint error comes out . 
> Expected the first argument to be an inline function expressioneslint(react-compiler/react-compiler)


```ts
  const debouncedSearch = useCallback(debounce(async (query: string) => {
    const response = await fetch(`api/search/quotes?query=${query}`);
      if(response.ok) {
        const { results } = await response.json();
        setResults(results);
      }
      else {
        setResults([]);
      }
  },300),[]);
```

how can I pass function be wrapped by another function as a argument in hooks without breaking this lint rule?  Should I just not use `useCallback` in this case?
