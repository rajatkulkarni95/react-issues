### Bug: Request for Maintainer Role in fa.react.dev Repository

> Issue #31322 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31322)

Hi,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to bring to your attention that there seems to be no active maintainer reviewing the pull requests for the [fa.react.dev](https://github.com/reactjs/fa.react.dev) repository at the moment. As someone passionate about translating React documentation into Persian, I would like to contribute further by not only submitting pull requests but also helping maintain the repository.

I have already submitted a pull request ([#423](https://github.com/reactjs/fa.react.dev/pull/423)) for this project, but it hasn’t been reviewed yet. I would be thrilled to take a more active role in ensuring the progress of the translation.

I believe my active involvement can support the progress of the translation, and I would be more than happy to assist in managing the pull requests and other repository tasks to keep everything moving forward smoothly.

Please let me know if this would be possible. I’m eager to contribute in any way I can.

Best regards,
Mohammad Reza

### Bug: Controlled state input weird behavior when state update is postponed to the next micro task

> Issue #31182 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31182)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version: v18.3

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Open the codesandbox link below
2. Add characters in the middle of each input
3. The first input works as expected. In the second input, the cursor will instantly jump to the end, also input methods will not work.

<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.
-->

Link to code example: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/74mhkd

<!--
  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a
  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the
  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is
  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal
  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
-->

## The current behavior
By adding an additional queueMicrotask to the second input, two inputs behavior are different.

## The expected behavior
Work loop stuff should not affect DOM manipulation.

Is it a bug or feature? Is it a react stuff?
