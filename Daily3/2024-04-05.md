React version: reproduced on 17 and 18

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Create an input like this: `<input text="move the selection around" onSelect={console.log} type="email" />`
2. Move the selection around and see that onSelect is emitted only on focus and blur. Notice that you get normal behavior if you remove the type
