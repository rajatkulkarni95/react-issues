React version: 19.0.0

## Steps To Reproduce

1. I tried to getting data at server by using `use()` and avoid using `useEffect()` in client component for performance

  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.

Link to code example:

```typescript
'use server'

import { use } from 'react'
import { getItsmeStores } from '@/actions/itsme-v1/store/action'
import ItsmeStoreRadio from '@/components/store-radio/itsme-store-radio'
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import Loading from '@/app/(main)/store/product-categories/loading'
import { getItsmeProductCategories } from '@/actions/itsme-v1/store/category/action'
import StoreProductCategoriesContent from '@/app/(main)/store/product-categories/_components/content'

type StoreProductCategoriesPageProps = {
  searchParams: { [key: string]: string | undefined }
}

const StoreProductCategoriesPage = async (
  props: StoreProductCategoriesPageProps,
) => {
  const { searchParams } = props
  const storeID = searchParams?.store_id ?? ''
  const stores = use(getItsmeStores()) // ❗️ getting error
  const initialCategories = use(getItsmeProductCategories(storeID)) //❗️ getting error

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <ItsmeStoreRadio stores={stores} />
      <StoreProductCategoriesContent
        storeID={storeID as string}
        initialCategories={initialCategories}
      />
    </Suspense>
  )
}

export default StoreProductCategoriesPage
```

## The current behavior
- And then, I could find the error in terminal
```terminal
  ⨯ [Error: failed to pipe response] {
[cause]: [Error: Expected a suspended thenable. This is a bug in React. Please file an issue.] {
 digest: '1982665415'
  }
 }
```

so I tried to getting static storeID instead of getting searchParams by props.
But, it didn`t work.. :(

## The expected behavior

But, I found the reason...!
Remove `async()` is the answer.

And if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could explain in detail the cause of this issue.

thank you.
