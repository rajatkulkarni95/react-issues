### Bug: `cache` API Not Caching Functions with Object Parameter

> Issue #31390 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31390)

When using the `cache` utility to cache function that takes an object as input, the caching doesn't work.

## React version:
All versions that include the cache API.

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a function using the `cache` utility, with a destructured parameter object as input:
   ```typescript
   import { cache } from "react";

   interface Props {
     params: Promise<{ query?: string; page?: number }>;
   }

   const getPosts = cache(async ({ query, page }: Props["params"]) => {
     // Function logic
   });
   ```

2. Attempt to call `getPosts` multiple times with the same parameters.

3. Observe that caching does not occur, and the function executes on each call instead of retrieving from cache.

In comparison, if the function is structured to accept individual parameters (as shown below), caching works as expected:

```typescript
import { cache } from "react";

const getPosts = cache(async (query?: string, page?: number) => {
  // Function logic
});
```

## The current behavior

When `getPosts` accepts an object as input, caching does not work, and the function executes anew for each call, even with identical parameters.

## The expected behavior

`cache` should correctly cache function calls, regardless of whether the input is provided as individual parameters or a single object. In this case, `getPosts` should only execute once per unique set of parameters, reusing the cached result for subsequent calls with identical parameters.
