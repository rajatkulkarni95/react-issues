### [React 19] new compiler handle the memoization of a function used in useEffect

> Issue #31925 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31925)

previously:

const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleAction = useCallback(() => {
    console.log(count);
  }, [count]);

  useEffect(() => {
    handleAction();
  }, [handleAction]);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>;
};

in react 19 with the new compiler. can i write it simpler like: 

const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleAction = () => {
    console.log(count);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    handleAction();
  }, [handleAction]);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>;
};

and the new compiler handle the memoization of handleAction function ?

### Bug: inconsistent type checking behaviour for useState

> Issue #31451 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31451)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version: 18.3.1

## Steps To Reproduce

1. declare a useState that accept the type: `Record<number, Record<number, true>>` 
2. when trying to use the `setState` function that is returned by `useState`, the type checking is inconsistent between an object that's assigned to a `const` and assigning the object directly

## The current behavior

`setState` does not complain. 

## The expected behavior

`setState` should complain about the `newState` type
