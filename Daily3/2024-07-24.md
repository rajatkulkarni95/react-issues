> Issue #31578 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31578)

## Summary

The setter from useState becomes arity 2 in React's 19.0.0-rc.1 release.

Haven't found a changelog entry (https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19 or https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide), neither looking at the commits, so I'm not sure if it's intentional or I might miss something here.
