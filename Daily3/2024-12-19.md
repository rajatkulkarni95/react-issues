React version: 19.0.0

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Call `useEffect()` - note the lack of arguments

* https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/repros/tree/react-use-effect-no-arguments

## The current behavior

```plaintext
Uncaught TypeError: create is not a function

```

## The expected behavior

Ideally not crash - or crash with a better error message?

In #15197 the reviews seemed to pointed towards a dev-only warning, rather than an invariant.

Re-opening of #15194 because the stalebot closed it.
