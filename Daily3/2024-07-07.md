### [React 19] Bug : Weird behavior when changing the order of a list

> Issue #31553 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31553)

# Explanations :

It seems to have some weird behavior introduced in the React 19 RC update. When we iterate over a list to create components and put a unique id as a key, when sorting certain elements are rerendered. Which was not the case in version 18.

# The effect :

```js
//In each item

useEffect(() => {
  const doc = ref.current;
  if (!doc) {
    return;
  }

  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    doc.animate(
      [{ outlineColor: "#d20f39" }, { outlineColor: "transparent" }],
      {
        duration: 300,
        easing: "cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)",
        iterations: 2,
      }
    );
  }, 500);

  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
  };
}, [item.title]);
```

### [Compiler Bug]: Discriminated unions with undefined cause compiler to blow up

> Issue #31420 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31420)

### What kind of issue is this?

- [X] React Compiler core (the JS output is incorrect, or your app works incorrectly after optimization)
- [ ] babel-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the Babel plugin)
- [ ] eslint-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the eslint plugin)
- [ ] react-compiler-healthcheck (build issue installing or using the healthcheck script)

### Repro steps

When you have a function that returns a discriminated union where an object can be undefined from a hook, you still need to add a property guard when accessing a nested property, because the compiler tries to check the value without knowing that it may be undefined.

This is a bit of a gotcha as Typescript is smart enough to allow this code through, but the compiler then blows up.

```
type DiscriminatedA = {
  isSuccess: true;
  data: { key: string };
}

type DiscriminatedB = {
  isSuccess: false;
  data: never;
}

type Discriminated = DiscriminatedA | DiscriminatedB;

const useUnion: () => Discriminated = () => {
  return { isSuccess: false }
}

function X() {
  const closureData: Discriminated = useUnion();
  const doSomething = () => {
    if (!isSuccess) {
      return
    }
    console.log(closureData.data.key);
  }
  return <div onClick={doSomething}></div>
}
```

If you do `closureData.data?.key` this works.

On a separate note, most of the issues we had previously with the compiler have been fixed, good work team.

### Bug: State updates are being reordered across await in an effect

> Issue #31306 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31306)

## Summary

<!--
  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a
  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the
  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is
  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal
  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
-->
**Steps To Reproduce :**

```
useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
        setStateA("foo");
        await someAsyncFunctionThatReturnsImmediately();
        setStateA("bar");
    })();
});
```
**The current behavior :**

In React, the second state update ("bar") is rendered first, followed by the first update ("foo"). This reordering occurs only when the awaited function returns immediately. If the awaited promise resolves later, the state updates in the expected order.

In the example, you can observe this by clicking the button and checking the console for the message "BUG RENDERED!!!shockshockshock", or by noticing a brief red flash on the component when it renders incorrectly. The console message appears every time, while the red flash happens occasionally. In our actual app, the incorrect render occurs consistently.

If you modify the example to call await optionalDelay(true), the state updates will be applied in order, and the component will flash green.
