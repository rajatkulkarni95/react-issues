## Note
Actually, I'm not really sure it's a bug or mine misunderstanding.
While hook is executed in function component by order (e.g. useState), each state hook memorize its own value, useTransition hook not do this in same way. I found it in another project, and simplify to codesandbox. The reason why I use two because I have two section in viewport relying on two sources (API) with different responding speed. I intend to let first response data show immediately and the other keep loading status by useTransition.
