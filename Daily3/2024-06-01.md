### Bug: Change status variable type

> Issue #31467 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31467)

I noticed the status variable in the ReactPromise function of the ReactFlightClient file, is of type any.

If the status is always of type String, it would be a good idea to replace `any` with `string`. This helps provide stronger type checking, reduces the risk of bugs, and improves code readability.

line: 206
