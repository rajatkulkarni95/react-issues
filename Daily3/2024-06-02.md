### [React 19]

> Issue #31370 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31370)

## Summary

I tried to setup React 19 using `vite`. First I created the vite/react template and then upgraded react and react-dom.
When trying to use Server components through async component, I am getting this error: "async/await is not yet supported in Client Components, only Server Components. This error is often caused by accidentally adding `'use client'` to a module that was originally written for the server. Error Component Stack"

Starter code is almost empty:
```jsx
export default async function App() {
    return <div>Starter template</div>;
}
```
I just wanted to test the server components without a server section in the [doc](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components#server-components-without-a-server).

I am I missing something?
Thanks in advance.
