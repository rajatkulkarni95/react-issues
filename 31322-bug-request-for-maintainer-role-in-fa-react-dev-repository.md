## Description

Hi,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to bring to your attention that there seems to be no active maintainer reviewing the pull requests for the [fa.react.dev](https://github.com/reactjs/fa.react.dev) repository at the moment. As someone passionate about translating React documentation into Persian, I would like to contribute further by not only submitting pull requests but also helping maintain the repository.

I have already submitted a pull request ([#423](https://github.com/reactjs/fa.react.dev/pull/423)) for this project, but it hasn’t been reviewed yet. I would be thrilled to take a more active role in ensuring the progress of the translation.

I believe my active involvement can support the progress of the translation, and I would be more than happy to assist in managing the pull requests and other repository tasks to keep everything moving forward smoothly.

Please let me know if this would be possible. I’m eager to contribute in any way I can.

Best regards,
Mohammad Reza
