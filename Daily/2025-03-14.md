### Avoid errors when dispatching mount operations within mount hooks

> Issue #50091 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50091)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

If a library uses mount hooks to perform mount operations, it's possible to get concurrent modifications of the list of pending surface IDs to report.

This fixes that potential error by making a copy of the list before dispatching the mount notifications.
