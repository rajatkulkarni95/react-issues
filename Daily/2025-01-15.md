### Make `DispatchCommandMountItem`, `MountItemFactory`, `MountItem` & `BatchMountItem` internal

> Issue #49893 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49893)

## Summary:

As part of the initiative to reduce the public API surface, these classes under com.facebook.react.fabric.mounting.mountitems can be internalized. I've checked there are no relevant OSS usages:

### Remove usage of folly::to

> Issue #49786 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49786)

Summary:
Most of these call-sites are only used for exceptional scenarios, so we can just rely on std::to_string and do string concatenation. For a few others that may be more perf-sensitive, I switched over to `snprintf`.
