[GENERAL] [FIXED] - Changed cron timings to run at fix schedule and upgraded action for better debugging

Root cause:
- The cron job (cron: "0 /6 * *") is expected to run every 6 hours.
- Expected runs: 5:54 AM → 11:54 AM → 5:54 PM.
- However, the second run happened earlier at 11:37 AM instead of 11:54 AM.
- This caused duplicate pings for issues created around 5:42:24 AM.
