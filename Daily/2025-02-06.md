### No such module 'ReactAppDependencyProvider'

> Issue #49704 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49704)

### Description

I’m encountering an issue when running pod install in my React Native project. This happens not only in my project but also in any other React Native project I’ve found online.

After running pod install, which generates the Xcode project for building the corresponding iOS app, the build fails with the following error in AppDelegate:

java
Copia codice
no such module 'ReactAppDependencyProvider'
It seems like this missing module is supposed to contain the entire project’s dependencies, but for some reason, it is not being recognized. I suspect that something is preventing CocoaPods from correctly linking the necessary modules.

I've tried standard troubleshooting steps such as:

Running pod install again after cleaning the ios folder.
Deleting Podfile.lock and Pods and reinstalling dependencies.
Ensuring that the React and React-Core modules are correctly included in the Podfile.
However, the issue persists. Does anyone know what could be causing this or how to properly link the missing module?




### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a react-native project
2. Run pod install
3. Run npx react-native run-ios

### React Native Version

0.76.5

### Affected Platforms

Runtime - iOS

### Output of `npx @react-native-community/cli info`

```text
Error unknown command info
```

### Stacktrace or Logs

```text
no such module ReactAppDependencyProvider

### Create specific module in RN to define the types for host instances and host components that ReactNativeTypes defines

> Issue #49601 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49601)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

This creates a new module in React Native to define some of the types related to `HostInstance` that are currently defined in `ReactNativeTypes` (synced from the React repo).

We want to remove the types from `ReactNativeTypes` so this is a necessary initial step.
