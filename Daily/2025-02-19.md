### iOS - TextInput shows password suggestion in the field above when secureTextEntry is enabled

> Issue #49932 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49932)

### Description


I will use an exemple of first and second TextInput fields:
- FirstField is with `autoComplete="off"`, `importantForAutofill="no"`,` textContentType="none"` and `secureTextEntry={false}`;
- SecondField is with autoComplete='password-new and textContentType='newPassword'' and secureTextEntry={true};

On iOS, the system's autofill behavior is causing a conflict with TextInput fields in React Native. Even with the correct configurations of `autoComplete="off"` and `textContentType="none`" on the first field, iOS continues to suggest saved passwords, but applies them to the wrong field. This happens especially when the bottom field (with secureTextEntry={true}) is set, but iOS tries to autofill the first field (which should not receive suggestions) with password information, ignoring the autoComplete="off" and importantForAutofill="no" configurations.


### Steps to reproduce

- open an app with two inputs;
- set secureTextEmpty as true on the bottom Input;
- if you open the app, the password suggestion will appear on the first input and not only in the second one.

### React Native Version

0.76.6

### Affected Platforms

Runtime - iOS
