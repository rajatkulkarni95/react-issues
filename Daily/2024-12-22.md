### Fix: Prevent "Cannot read handle of undefined" error in Metro dev server

> Issue #49861 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49861)

Fixes an issue where Connect middleware expects either a function or an object with a 'handle' property, which causes "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'handle')" errors when indexPageMiddleware is missing or improperly formatted. Added robust fallback middleware and proper format checking.

(Was initially https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49847)

<!-- Thanks for submitting a pull request! We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory. -->

## Motivation

When trying to start a React Native application using `npx react-native start`, users may encounter an error related to the Connect middleware system being unable to read the `handle` property from an undefined middleware. This occurs because:

1. The Connect middleware system expects either a function or an object with a `handle` method
2. The current implementation doesn't properly handle cases where `indexPageMiddleware` is missing or not correctly formatted
3. There's no proper fallback when the community package doesn't export the expected middleware

## Summary:

This PR fixes an issue where the React Native development server crashes with the error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'handle')` when starting the Metro bundler.

### Changes:
The changes in this PR:

1. Add a default middleware object with a proper `handle` method that safely passes control to the next middleware
2. Add robust error handling when importing the community middleware
3. Ensure middleware is always in a format compatible with Connect (object with `handle` method)
4. Export the `indexPageMiddleware` so it's available to other modules

## Changelog:

[GENERAL] [FIXED] - Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'handle')" error when starting Metro dev server.

## Test Plan:

1. Create a new React Native project 
2. Try to start the dev server with `npx react-native start`
3. Verify it starts without the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'handle')" error
4. Verify that all dev server functionality works properly (loading pages, hot reloading, etc.)

### Fix missing type for login-password alert prompt

> Issue #49757 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49757)

## Summary:
When using the `login-password` prompt type, there is a TypeScript type mismatch issue. The `callbackOrButtons` parameter returns an object with `{login: string, password: string}` structure, but this type variation is not properly included in the **AlertType** type definition. This causes TypeScript to show type errors when using callback functions that expect credentials in the format `(credentials: {login: string, password: string}) => void`.

## Changelog:
- [General] [Fixed] Add missing type variation `{login: string, password: string}` to **AlertType** type definition to properly support `login-password` prompt callbacks

## Test Plan:
This change is purely type-related and doesn't affect runtime behavior.

### Back out "Throw exception with name of TurboModule instead of deadlock during sync rendering"

> Issue #49554 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49554)

Summary:
For some reason, this diff completely breaks the linker on iOS.

I tried to look for a fix forward, but unsuccessfully.

I'm reverting this diff to get CI green again, but this requires more investigation.

### Sort entry points, add clipboard and  AccessibilityInfo

Summary:
Changelog: [Internal]

Sorts the entry points in the TS generator script and adds `Clipboard` and `AccessibilityInfo` which, as far as I can see, require no changes for their types to align with OSS.
