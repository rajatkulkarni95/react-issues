### Increase Hermes Sampling rate to 10kHz

> Issue #49795 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49795)

Summary:
# Changelog: [Internal]

I've been able to reliably and consistently record samples with an interval between 2 consecutive ones to be ~0.1-0.2ms, lets bump the sampling frequency to have more frames.

On Windows, Hermes Sampler peaks at ~500Hz, so this won't have much effect.

### Gradle to 8.13

Summary:
I'm bumping Gradle to the latest minor.
https://docs.gradle.org/8.13/release-notes.html

I'm also changing the distribution from `all` to `bin` as
this reduces the download time of the distribution.

### Reland: Throw exception with name of TurboModule instead of deadlock during sync rendering

> Issue #49587 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49587)

Summary:
This is a reland diff for D69805065.

The problems with the original diff were:
- wrong header search path in the `React-NativeModuleApple.podspec`
- adding an implementation `RuntimeExecutor.cpp` file to implement a function that is used by an inline function in the `RuntimeExecutor.h`.

I believe that the last point specifically was creating issues to the linker which was not able to resolve the symbols properly in transitive dependencies.

The fix was to move the implementation of `getMainThreadMutex` to be `inline`.
