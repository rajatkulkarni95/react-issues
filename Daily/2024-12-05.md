### 0.77: Animated make some views disappearing (Android)

> Issue #49838 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49838)

### Description

Hi! 
My app use `Animated` to show a toast message on top of different screens. After updating my app to 0.77.x, every time the toast disappears, also the other views below disappears, breaking my app.
I have been able to reproduce a similar case with the reproducer. The same example is working fine with 0.76.x.
I also saw that in 0.77.x many changes have been made to Animated so it's clearly that something is broken due to those changes.
Can you please have a look? It's preventing me to update the app 🙏 Thanks!

### Steps to reproduce

1. Run the reproducer app on Android
2. Click the button
3. See that a toast message appears, but when it disappears after a few seconds, also the red view disappears.

FYI It seems that if I don't set a background color to the main view the bug doesn't happen.

### Expose rootTag in Root

> Issue #49251 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49251)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

Components like `AppContainer` require passing the rootTag as a prop, but we don't have access to it from Fantom unless we render something in the root and access it via the RootTagContext. This exposes the rootTag of the Root as a method so we can use it in initial render too.
