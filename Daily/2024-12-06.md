### fix race condition in getPages test for device disconnection

> Issue #49741 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49741)

Summary:
While the test delay `PAGES_POLLING_DELAY` is usually enough to be equal to `PAGES_POLLING_INTERVAL`, in some cases we need extra time to sync that with the polling in `Devices.js`.

Changelog:
[General][Internal] - fix test

### Regression: Elevation shadow fix (#48874) missing in React Native 0.78.0 stable release

> Issue #49538 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49538)

### Description

It looks like the fix for elevation shadows on Android, introduced in issue [#48874](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/48874) and committed in [f7d78f8](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f7d78f81cc971be2dcf5476c790556df4220b2bc), is not included in the React Native 0.78.0 stable release.

This results in elevation-based shadows still not rendering correctly, despite the issue being marked as fixed.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a simple View component with an elevation style.
2. Run the app on an Android device.
3. Observe that the shadow does not appear as expected, similar to the behavior before #48874 was fixed.

### React Native Version

0.78.0

### Affected Platforms

Runtime - Android

### Gradle Configuration Cache - Round 2

> Issue #49438 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49438)

Summary:
This is the second part of a series of diff needed to enable G. Configuration Cache:
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html
as it will make our CI faster (and will be the default in the future Gradle version).

Here I'm making the exec tasks CC friendly.

The problem is that previously we were using explicit streams which are not CC friendly
for stderr/stdout. The solution is to create a custom task and handle files as input
properties.

> Issue #49252 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49252)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

This adds a Fantom test placeholder for LogBox, which shows what type of tests we could be writing for this.

It also adds a few ids in LogBox components so we can inspect them in tests and make assertions on them.
