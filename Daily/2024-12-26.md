<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->

If you use this preset to create library code, it is often helpful to be able to still read the transpiled code, even when sourcemaps are available.

This change adds a compact option which allows for disabling the default behavior that removes whitespace from the transpiled files.

### chore(community-cli-plugin): Remove extraneous `@react-native/metro-babel-transformer`

> Issue #49558 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49558)

## Summary:

Opening this as a separate PR, since I'm not sure if I'm missing something, or if there's any intention behind this.

`@react-native/metro-babel-transformer` is used by `@react-native/metro-config` and is referenced in code there and as a dependency there. It's also sometimes mentioned as package for community CLI users to install directly. However, there's seemingly no reason `@react-native/metro-babel-transformer` needs to depend on it, or any code that relies on it directly.

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL] [CHANGED] - Remove extraneous `@react-native/metro-babel-transformer` dependency from community-cli-plugin

## Test Plan:

- n/a
