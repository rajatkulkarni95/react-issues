> Issue #49989 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49989)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

We verified that the refactor is safe using a production experiment, so we can ship this version that doesn't require state updates and has slightly better performance

### marked acquireWakeLockNow as static as it was static before

> Issue #49875 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49875)


<!-- Thanks for submitting a pull request! We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory. -->

## Summary:

acquireWakeLockNow was static before but wasn't marked as static in https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9afad527b831ec0c5d50e88daacbaacbc476d478  when changing code to Kotlin.

This breaks react-native-firebase but I've submitted the bug report there as I guess it might be fixed there too.

## Changelog:

[ANDROID] [FIXED] - Marked acquireWakeLockNow as static


## Test plan:

No tests as it reverts the broken change

### Split index.js types into index.js.flow

> Issue #49470 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49470)

Summary:
Adds a `packages/react-native/index.js.flow` file.

**Motivation**

This is on the critical path to generating TypeScript types, and a full API snapshot, from `index.js.flow`.

As we iterate, this new file will move to closely matching `types/index.d.ts` by adding type exports (missing today) — giving us an equivalent public API in both languages.

**Motivation for this pattern**

Having a type index file:

- Will become the entry point for `yarn build-types`.
- Enables us to bypass the `module.exports` pattern in `index.js` without a runtime breaking change.
    - This pattern is preferable because:
        - 1/ Aligns with existing manual TypeScript definitions (i.e. these are **already restricted** to `import` syntax in user code)
        - 2/ Allows doc comments on original types to propagate to IDEs/users.

**Implementation notes**

NOTE: This diff has **no effect** on compiled code at runtime, and **no effect** on the current manual TypeScript API of `react-native`. It only has an effect on Flow usage in fbsource — most of which are deep type imports today.

- Exports are grouped and sorted identically to each pre-existing getter in `index.js`.

Changelog: [Internal] - Redefine root `react-native` type exports, affecting Flow usages only

### decouple jsc when USE_THIRD_PARTY_JSC=1 on ios

> Issue #49371 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49371)

## Summary:

an effort of lean core for jsc: https://github.com/Kudo/discussions-and-proposals/blob/%40kudo/lean-core-jsc/proposals/0836-lean-core-jsc.md. this pr tries to decouple all jsc code when `USE_THIRD_PARTY_JSC=1` on ios

this pr includes these changes:
- exclude `React-jsc` pod and pod dependency when `USE_THIRD_PARTY_JSC=1`
- in objcpp code, remove `JSCExecutorFactory` / `RCTJscInstance` references when `USE_THIRD_PARTY_JSC=1`. it throws c++ errors like `No JSRuntimeFactory specified.` when no engine is specified (USE_HERMES=0 && USE_THIRD_PARTY_JSC=1). people need to override delegate methods to specify a JSRuntimeFactory.

## Changelog:

[IOS] [CHANGED] - Decouple JSC when `USE_THIRD_PARTY_JSC=1`

## Test Plan:

- ci passed
- rn-tester build success for `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 USE_THIRD_PARTY_JSC=1 USE_HERMES=0 USE_FRAMEWORKS=dynamic bundle exec pod install`
- rn-tester build success for `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=0 USE_THIRD_PARTY_JSC=1 USE_HERMES=0 USE_FRAMEWORKS=dynamic bundle exec pod install`
- rn-tester build success for `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=0 USE_THIRD_PARTY_JSC=1 USE_HERMES=0 bundle exec pod install`

### Fix incorrect tokenization of non-exponential numbers ending with "E"

> Issue #49280 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49280)

Summary:
We were incorrectly consuming an `E` at the end of number tokens, even if not followed by a digit, which breaks dimension tokens where the unit starts with "E", like `em`. Follow the spec the right way:

https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#consume-number

> If the next 2 or 3 input code points are U+0045 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E (E) or U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E (e), optionally followed by U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-) or U+002B PLUS SIGN (+), followed by a digit, then...
