### batch debug logging for cdp messages

> Issue #49726 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49726)

Summary:
The `InspectorProxy` debug logging became incredibly spammy making it almost unuseful unless the output is manipulated so this commit batches all these cdp messages and only desplays how many were received in the span of 5s. If no messages are received, the throttle is not triggered.

To get the actual CDP messages logged, we still log these to `Metro:InspectorProxyCDPMessages`.

[General][Internal] batch debug logging for cdp messages

### How to surface unhandled rejections gracefully?

> Issue #49525 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49525)

### Description

The problem I am trying to solve is a related to https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-reactnative/issues/298

Problem: Unable to view unhandled rejections in my crash / error reporting tool : datadog. They just disappear.

Solution attempted: I have patched the promiseRejectionTrackingOptions file this way, but it isn't a fool proof way because Hermes doesn't use the default trackingOptions in this file

This is how my patch looks:

     }`;
+    listeners.forEach((listener) => listener(warning));
     if (__DEV__) {
       LogBox.addLog({
         level: 'warn',

I then add addUnhandledRejectionListener handler to the PromiseConstructor interface in global.d.ts file:

interface PromiseConstructor {
    addUnhandledRejectionListener(listener: (error: unknown) => void): () => void;
    removeUnhandledRejectionListener(listener: (error: unknown) => void): void;
  }
And hook the listener on startup this way in my app.tsx file

  const App = () => {

    .....
    useEffect(() => {
    void Analytics.appOpen()
      // Adding an unhandled promise rejection listener
      const unhandledPromiseRejectionListener = Promise.addUnhandledRejectionListener((error) => {
        datadog.captureException(error, { tags: { unhandledPromise: 'true' } });
      });
      return () => {
      unhandledPromiseRejectionListener(); // unsubscribing the listener
      };
    }, [])

When Hermes is used, this promise polyfill tweak is not working in our production build because of this line
https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/1954f166c9f2b22e1f3bff1a3cecddc15f9e7c31/packages/react-native/Libraries/Core/polyfillPromise.js#L28

Please suggest an optimal way to retrieve the unhandled promise rejection error in order to log into to error / crash reporting tool like datadog. Is there a different / more apt way to achieve this?

Thanks in advance,
Rama.

### Steps to reproduce

Fire such a function from any functional component in the app.

const unhandledRejectionFn = async() => {
    throw new Error('Unhandled Rejection');
  }

  useEffect(() => { 
    // most of our sdk instantiations happen in a non blocking fashion this way
    // need a way to be able to catch such rejections 
    void unhandledRejectionFn()
  }, [])

These unhandled rejections are not caught by datadog automatically.

### useColorScheme() returns incorrect value when app is moved to the background on iOS

> Issue #49330 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49330)

### Description

`useColorScheme()` call returns a momentarily incorrect value when the app is moved to the background. When bringing the app back in the foreground it causes a flashing behaviour, because all the components support dark and light theme. 
The issue appears on ExpoGo as well as on a physical device.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Set up a minimal environment for React Native on iOS 
2. Call `scheme = useColorScheme()`
3. console.log `scheme`
4. Move the app to the background (ex.: switch to another app)
5. Move back the app in the foreground
6. See how `scheme` value was changed (to dark if you were on light theme or inverse) when the app was moved to the background and changed back again

### Fix new arch refresh control not shown when refreshing on mount

> Issue #49240 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49240)

## Summary:

- In the old architecture on iOS, it was possible to begin refreshing a [`RefreshControl`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/refreshcontrol) backed by  [`RCTRefreshControl.m`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/ea876054cfdcdfba1d8ded69ab359f20072aef6c/packages/react-native/React/Views/RefreshControl/RCTRefreshControl.m) on mount (see [old arch rn-tester video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a759072-8931-438b-b9af-698b5f8fa072)).
- In the new architecture on iOS, when attempting to refresh on mount, the `RefreshControl` backed by [`RCTPullToRefreshViewComponentView.mm`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/ea876054cfdcdfba1d8ded69ab359f20072aef6c/packages/react-native/React/Fabric/Mounting/ComponentViews/ScrollView/RCTPullToRefreshViewComponentView.mm) is not shown. Additionally, recycled `RefreshControl`s are missing their [`title`s](https://reactnative.dev/docs/refreshcontrol#title-ios) (see [new arch rn-tester video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22f87a82-4703-470b-9c00-6454eb9458dd)).
- This change fixes the new arch issues mentioned above, so that the new arch behaves the same as the old arch did (see [new arch rn-tester video with fix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ab6c90c-6ad4-4dc7-b2f5-7cf1378e50b9)).
- This change also updates the rn-tester [`RefreshControlExample`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/442a368af5bda653e84514b870084c73607645eb/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/RefreshControl/RefreshControlExample.js) to include a refresh-on-mount to prevent future regressions

## Changelog:

[IOS] [FIXED] - Fix new arch RefreshControl wasn't shown when refreshing on mount
[IOS] [FIXED] - Fix new arch recycled RefreshControl was missing its title
[INTERNAL] [CHANGED] - Update rn-tester RefreshControlExample to refresh on mount

## Test Plan:

- I created a [video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a759072-8931-438b-b9af-698b5f8fa072) of the baseline old arch behavior by overriding [`new_arch_enabled`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/react-native/scripts/cocoapods/new_architecture.rb#L163-L165) to return `false`
- I created a [video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22f87a82-4703-470b-9c00-6454eb9458dd) of the broken new arch behavior by overriding [`new_arch_enabled`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/react-native/scripts/cocoapods/new_architecture.rb#L163-L165) to return `true`
- I applied the changes in this PR and created a [video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ab6c90c-6ad4-4dc7-b2f5-7cf1378e50b9) that confirms that the new arch with fix now behaves the same as the old arch
- I also used [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) to verify that the changes in this PR work as expected in my production React Native app, running `react-native@0.77.0`, with the new arch now enabled by default. Note that this app uses [`react-navigation`](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) and [`react-native-screens`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens), which I expected might complicate the fix. The changes in this PR continue to work as expected, even with the complications of those popular libraries.

## Details:
- All of my changes were inspired by the many years of fixes that are included in [`RCTRefreshControl.m`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/ea876054cfdcdfba1d8ded69ab359f20072aef6c/packages/react-native/React/Views/RefreshControl/RCTRefreshControl.m), which haven't yet been included in the new [`RCTPullToRefreshViewComponentView.mm`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/ea876054cfdcdfba1d8ded69ab359f20072aef6c/packages/react-native/React/Fabric/Mounting/ComponentViews/ScrollView/RCTPullToRefreshViewComponentView.mm)
    - My `_isBeforeInitialLayout` is inspired by the old [`_isInitialRender`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/442a368af5bda653e84514b870084c73607645eb/packages/react-native/React/Views/RefreshControl/RCTRefreshControl.m#L17)
    - My `layoutSubviews` is inspired by the old [`layoutSubviews`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/442a368af5bda653e84514b870084c73607645eb/packages/react-native/React/Views/RefreshControl/RCTRefreshControl.m#L43-L59)
    - My `beginRefreshingProgrammatically` is inspired by the old [`beginRefreshingProgrammatically`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/442a368af5bda653e84514b870084c73607645eb/packages/react-native/React/Views/RefreshControl/RCTRefreshControl.m#L72-L107)
- I have tried to comment all of the unexpected changes. Some of these comments are taken directly from the old `RCTRefreshControl.m`
- In general, it seems like [`UIRefreshControl`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uirefreshcontrol) ignores many style updates, and even calls to `beginRefreshing`, until it's been added to the view hierarchy. That's why the `layoutSubviews` hack was needed in the old arch, and is similarly needed in this PR. 
    - Here's a [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67758859) that hints at this, by saying that `beingRefreshing` needed to be called in a ViewController's `viewWillAppear` lifecycle callback
    - Here's a different [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32688124) that shows that `viewWillLayoutSubviews` (and by extension, all of the subviews' `layoutSubviews`) is indeed called after `viewWillAppear`
- Since `_refreshControl` effectively ignores updates until the first `layoutSubviews` call, I needed to buffer all calls to `updateProps:oldProps:` into my new `_initialProps` before finally re-calling `updateProps:oldProps:` with `_initialProps` against `PullToRefreshViewShadowNode::defaultSharedProps` in `layoutSubviews`
- Additionally, I needed to move the `if` block regarding refreshing from the top of `updateProps:oldProps:` to the bottom of it, because `_refreshControl` ignores updates that are made after the call to `beginRefreshing`

## Known issues:
- There is one small difference between the old arch and the new arch with this PR. The old arch [programmatically animates the pull down content offset](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/442a368af5bda653e84514b870084c73607645eb/packages/react-native/React/Views/RefreshControl/RCTRefreshControl.m#L89-L102), whereas this PR does not. See `[scrollView setContentOffset:offset]` in the PR code.
    - I tried animating it with the block below, and this did work in the rn-tester app. However, it caused the fix to not work when used with the extremely popular `react-navigation` and `react-native-screens` libraries. In that case, the `RefreshControl` exhibited the same buggy behavior of not being shown when refreshing on mount.
    ```objective-c
    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.25 delay:0 options:UIViewAnimationOptionBeginFromCurrentState animations:^{
        [_scrollViewComponentView.scrollView setContentOffset:offset];
    } completion:^(BOOL finished) {
        [_refreshControl beginRefreshing];
    }];
    ```
    - I thought it would be better to fix this for a larger number of real-world scenarios without animation than it would be to fix it for just the rn-tester app with animation.
