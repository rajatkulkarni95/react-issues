### create a heartbeat for device, and not only for debugger

> Issue #49618 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49618)

Summary:
Changelog:
[General][Internal] - create a heartbeat for device, and not only for debugger.

Introducing a heartbeat for the connection between the proxy and the device similarly to the one between the proxy and the debugger. This will allow us to:
* Most importantly I'd like to track the ping-pong roundtrip to the device as well, to see if we have any anomalies there
* Terminate the connection if it is abandoned for 60seconds- this might have a real effect in some case where the device runs remotely
* Also keep that connection alive if the other side disconnects after a period of inactivity. While a no-op in our case, this is an implementation detail. It is a no-op because the WebSocket on the Device is implemented by us and is not supposed to drop connections like the browser does.

### Introduce EventBeat::unstable_setInduceCallback to batch sync state updates

> Issue #49520 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49520)

Summary:
changelog: [internal]

Adds a new callback to EventBeat that is triggered in EventBeat::induce (that is when the UI thread is about to go IDLE). This will make state updates applied synchronously before the OS has a chance to paint but they will be batched. If two state updates happen in single UI tick, the will be executed at the end of UI's run loop.

The state updates are still not batched into a single commit. If two state updates happen on the same component, they are coalesced. If two state updates happen on two different components, they will generate two transactions. This is a follow up optimisation.

This feature is hidden behind `ReactNativeFeatureFlags::enableSynchronousStateUpdates` which is a preexisting feature flag. The feature flag was not rolled out yet and is not being used in any QEs at the moment.

### Gradle Configuration Cache - Round 1

> Issue #49421 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49421)

Summary:
This is a first part of a series of diff needed to enable G. Configuration Cache:
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html
as it will make our CI faster (and will be the default in the future Gradle version).

Here I'm making all those tasks `prepare*` CC friendly.

Those tasks were not CC friendly as they were referencing an external variable inside their body.
We don't need to know the library version, we can just substring after the first folder
and the tasks will behave as before.

### fix: correctly forward dependency on `@react-native-community/cli-server-api`

> Issue #49325 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49325)

## Summary:

`@react-native/community-cli-plugin` depends on `@react-native-community/cli-server-api` but incorrectly declares it as optional. When the dependency is not found, the `bundle` and `start` commands are not registered. This change removes the optional flag and forwards the dependency to consumers of `react-native`.

Resolves #47309

## Changelog:

[GENERAL] [FIXED] - Fix `@react-native-community/cli-server-api` not being found under certain hoisting conditions

## Test Plan:

See #47309 for repro steps.

As part of the initiative to reduce the public API surface, this class can be internalized. I've checked there are [no relevant OSS usages](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=NOT+is%3Afork+NOT+org%3Afacebook+NOT+repo%3Areact-native-tvos%2Freact-native-tvos+NOT+repo%3Anuagoz%2Freact-native+NOT+repo%3A2lambda123%2Freact-native+NOT+repo%3Abeanchips%2Ffacebookreactnative+NOT+repo%3AfabOnReact%2Freact-native-notes+NOT+user%3Ahuntie+com.facebook.react.uimanager.style.Overflow).
