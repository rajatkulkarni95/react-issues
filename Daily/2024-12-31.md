### Record React Native process and Main thread

> Issue #49370 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49370)

Summary:
# Changelog: [Internal]

When we start tracing, we will record metadata events for current process and thread.

> Important: This is based off the assumption that `Tracing.start` CDP method will be handled on main thread.

Once we have a separate thread for inspector, we should move this code to be explicitly run on Main thread.

### Reduce transform parsing duplication

> Issue #49279 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49279)

Summary:
I ended up using this same pattern for filter parsing where the logic betweeen functions is very similar. Let's deduplicate the logic for transform parsing a bit. This also separates `rotate()` and `rotateZ()` types, to be handled the same at a different layer.
