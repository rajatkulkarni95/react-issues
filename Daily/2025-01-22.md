### Add Fantom test for requestIdleCallback

> Issue #50019 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50019)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

This adds some basic tests for the API to show that it's working correctly.

This was in response to https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49684. If there are use cases that we think are incorrectly handled, we should add them to this test.

### Remove `_Nullable` from jni_lib_merge.

> Issue #49793 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49793)

Summary:
This is causing the `-Wno-nullability-extension` warning to fire.
As I'm looking into enabling `Wall Werror` for ReactCommon, this should be fixed as it's causing the build to fail.

We don't use nullability extensions at all in the other JNI_OnLoad files, so it's fine (and probably better) we
replace them with a function that also doens't specify a Nullability annotation.

This is impacting only the OSS So Merging toolchain.

## Summary:

As part of the initiative to reduce the public API surface, this class can be internalized.
