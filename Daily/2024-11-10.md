### Propagate the delegate invocation up to the RCTReactNativeFactory

> Issue #49609 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49609)

Summary:
This change propagates the delegate chain calls up until the `RCTReactNativeFactoryDelegate`.

## Problem
As of today, it is not possible to create a pure C++ TM and to register it through a Swift AppDelegate

## Solution
We can create a pod that can be imported in a Swift AppDelegate and that offer some pure Objective-C classes.

These classes contains a provider that can be instantiated in Swift.

The TurboModule manager delegate will ask the AppDelegate about the presence of some provider that can instantiate a pure C++ turbomodule with a given name.

The provider has an empty interface, but the implementation contains a function that can actually instantiate the TM. The function is implemented in an Objective-C++ class that imports the pure C++ turbomodule and creates it.

The TMManager extends the provider through a category to attaach the signature of the function that is implemented by the provider.

The last diff in this stack contains an exaple on how to implement this.

## Changelog:
[iOS][Added] - Added the delegate calls to forward the request for the CxxTurboModuleProvider from the Manager to the ReactNativeFactory

### Memory leak on requests using fetch(url

> Issue #49508 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49508)

### Description

Hello Guys!
we're trying to change our RN version for something after "react-native": "0.75.4", but we always face problems with memory leak.
using this version mentioned above everything is working fine, but when we try to use the new Arch we face this problem.
Now for example we tried to use the RN last version available: 0.77.1 and we still have the same result.

### Steps to reproduce

1 - install the application with npm install
2 - go to Configuracoes and insert the ID EMPRESA: 1340 and click in SALVAR
3 - Now you can choose any button option and check what is happening with the memory allocated, it never stop do increase until we have a memory leak, the app start to slow down.
to check the memory we are using the new RN DevTools  

### React Native Version

0.77.1

### Affected Platforms

Runtime - Android

### Areas

Other (please specify), Fabric - The New Renderer

### feat: added new workflow for issue monitoring in react native

> Issue #49225 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49225)

<!-- Thanks for submitting a pull request! We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory. -->

## Summary:

<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->

While triaging issues in the React Native repository, we face two major challenges:

- Missing Issues: The large volume of issues makes it difficult to ensure that none are overlooked.
- Ownership: There is no structured process to determine who should handle which issue.

To address these challenges, we are setting up this action.

## Changelog:

<!-- Help reviewers and the release process by writing your own changelog entry.

Pick one each for the category and type tags:

[GENERAL] [ADDED] - Added a new workflow to monitor new issue in repo.

For more details, see:
https://reactnative.dev/contributing/changelogs-in-pull-requests
-->

Here we are using this github action: https://github.com/react-native-community/repo-monitor to monitor new issues and then notify it on specific discord server to notify someone.

Currently this action runs every 6 hours.

Requirements:
- We need following inputs to make this workflow run:
   -  `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` to be added in secrets [Needed for posting message in specific channels]
   -  `role_id`: To notify a group.
 

## Test Plan:

<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->
