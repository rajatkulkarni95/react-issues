### Transform parsing

> Issue #49189 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49189)

Summary:
Allow parsing the set of currently supported transform functions, and lists of them, using `CSSTranformFunction` (which may decompose to e.g. `CSSScaleX`), and `CSSTransformList`.

A bit more duplication than I would like here, but a lot of these have subtle differences.
