### [ios][prebuild] fixed inclusion of resources in swift package

> Issue #50050 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50050)

## Summary:

We had some issues with the Swift package build step where we saw an error message when we included resources and couldn't find out why this was happening.

After systematically going through the generated swift package file and looking for a reason I found a mistake.

When we generate the Package.swift file we pass all compilerFlags from the configuration of the target to both cpp/c flags - which in the case of the folly target ends up being passed to the dependency scanner which isn't too happy about this c++ flag.

The solution was to split `compilerFlags` into `cCompilerFlags` and `cxxCompilerFlags`.

This commit fixes this by:
- split `compilerFlags` into `cCompilerFlags` and `cxxCompilerFlags`.
- Updated configuration with correct settings
- Updated Package.swift generation to use these new flags
- Fixed issue with the copy bundles step that didn't copy the directory in some cases.

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL]  - Fixed processing resources in the generated swift package for the RN Dependencies/prebuild

## Test-plan

Test by prebuilding RNDependencies, include the XCFramework in a new app and try to load resource bundles:

```obj-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  std::string input = "3.1416 xyz ";
  double_conversion::DoubleToStringConverter::EcmaScriptConverter();
  LOG(INFO) << "Hello from GLOG";
  fmt::print("Hello, world from FMT!\n");
  BOOST_ASSERT(100 == 100);
  double result;
  fast_float::from_chars(input.data(), input.data() + input.size(), result);
  LOG(INFO) << "Answer :" << result;
  
  NSArray *frameworks = [NSBundle allFrameworks];

  for (NSBundle *framework in frameworks) {
    NSString *frameworkName = framework.bundleURL.lastPathComponent;
    if ([frameworkName isEqualToString: @"ReactNativeDependencies.framework"]) {
      [self loadBundle:framework bundleName:@"ReactNativeDependencies_glog"];
      [self loadBundle:framework bundleName:@"ReactNativeDependencies_boost"];
      [self loadBundle:framework bundleName:@"ReactNativeDependencies_folly"];
      break;
    }
  }
  return YES;
}

- (void) loadBundle:(NSBundle*)framework bundleName: (NSString*)bundleName {
  NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle bundleWithURL:[framework bundleURL]];
  NSURL *bundleURL = [bundle URLForResource:bundleName withExtension:@"bundle"];
  NSBundle *resourceBundle = [NSBundle bundleWithURL:bundleURL];
  NSURL* url = [resourceBundle URLForResource:@"PrivacyInfo" withExtension:@"xcprivacy"];
  if (url == nil) {
    LOG(ERROR) << "Could not find PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy in the " << [bundleName UTF8String] << " bundle";
  } else {
    LOG(INFO) << "Found PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy in " << [bundleName UTF8String] << ".";
  }
}
```
