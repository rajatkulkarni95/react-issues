### Introduce Fantom.dispatchNativeEvent utility

> Issue #49254 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49254)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

This is just a convenience method to do:

```
Fantom.dispatchNativeEvent(node, 'click');
```

Instead of:

```
runOnUIThread(() => {
  enqueueNativeEvent(node, 'click');
});

runWorkLoop();
```

Which is too verbose and people rarely need this level of granularity in tests.
