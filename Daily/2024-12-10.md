Summary: As preparation for fixing focus on FlatList we need to prevent the currently focused view from getting clipped. This is because in Android, if the currently focused view gets clipped before transferring focus we crash.

## Summary:

Currently, when integrating into a native app using ReactNativeFactory, when we forget to set `dependencyProvider` we get a random crash exception instructing us (depending on native modules in our app) about an unrecognized selector:

### feat: add jsitooling package

> Issue #49348 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49348)

## Summary:

> [!NOTE] 
> This PR is part of JavaScriptCore Extraction to this repository: https://github.com/react-native-community/javascriptcore


This PR adds `jsitooling` package that third party JS engines can use (in that case javascriptcore). It's required because React-Runtime needs to depend on third-party engine on iOS, and the third-party engine needed to depend on React-Runtime to get access to the `JSRuntimeFactory` and Cocoapods doesn't support circular dependencies...

Now third-party engine can depenend on jsitooling package and provide JSRuntimeFactory

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL] [ADDED] - jsitooling package

### Modal Not Covering SafeAreaView and Status Bar on Android in React Native 0.77

> Issue #49256 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49256)

### Description

In React Native 0.77, the Modal component behaves inconsistently across platforms. On iOS, the modal correctly covers the entire screen, including the SafeAreaView and StatusBar. However, on Android, the modal does not cover the StatusBar or respect the SafeAreaView, leaving gaps at the top of the screen.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a Modal component with transparent={false}

Example Code
```
import React from 'react';
import { Modal, View, StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native';

const TestModal = ({ visible }) => {
    return (
        <Modal
            visible={visible}
            transparent={false}
            animationType="slide"
            statusBarTranslucent={true}
        >
            <View style={styles.container}>
                <View style={styles.content}>
                    <Text>Modal Content</Text>
                </View>
            </View>
        </Modal>
    );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: 'white',
    },
    content: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
    },
});

export default TestModal;
```
