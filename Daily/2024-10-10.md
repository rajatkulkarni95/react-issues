### Fix testOnly behavior in CI

> Issue #49192 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49192)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

We refactored the public API of Fantom benchmarks in https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49014 but that refactor broke test only mode, as we started overriding the options after setting them. This fixes that.
