### Scripts: remove checked-in `debugger;` statements

> Issue #49289 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49289)

Summary:
These snuck in, presumably accidentally, via https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49164.

This interferes with running test suites with a debugger connected (e.g, when debugging Jest itself).

(Aside: we should probably enable [`eslint/no-debugger`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-debugger) to catch these)

Changelog: [Internal]

Differential Revision: D69377992

> Issue #49197 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49197)

Summary:
changelog: [internal]

Adds new method to LayoutMetrics that calculates frame adjusted for overflow inset.


For example, for the following view hierarchy. it would produce a frame that would fully contain view A and view B.
```
┌─────────────┐
│<View A />   │
│     ┌───────┴─────┐
└─────┤<View B />   │
      │             │
      └─────────────┘
```
