### RNGP - Do not access .project inside GenerateCodegenSchemaTask

> Issue #49399 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49399)

Summary:
We should not invoke anything on the `project` property inside thet task.
That will break Gradle Configuration Caching which is becoming the default in the next version of Gradle.

This fixes it for the `GenerateCodegenSchemaTask` task.

### Fix @react-native/popup-menu-android not building for 3rd party developers

> Issue #49212 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49212)

Summary:
Currently, developers can't use `popup-menu-android` at all because the Gradle file we publish is referencing
internal machinery.

I'm adding a pre-publish script that manipulates the Gradle. This is the easiest solution without having to do
crazy setup inside RNGP or having duplicated version codes around in the monorepo.

Fixes https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49112

[Android] [Fixed] - Fix react-native/popup-menu-android not building for 3rd party developers
