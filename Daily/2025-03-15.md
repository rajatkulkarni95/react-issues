### Correctly compare oldProps in RCTPullToRefreshViewComponentView

> Issue #50092 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50092)

Summary:
`oldProps` can be null, so this is an unsafe dereference. We also typically compare with `_props`, which represents the previous state of the component.
