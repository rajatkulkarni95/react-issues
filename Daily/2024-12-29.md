### Allow the .pnpm folder to be discovered during code generation

> Issue #49983 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49983)

## Summary:

This PR (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/48182) introduced skipping hidden folders during Codegen generation.

However, when using pnpm, all files are stored in the `.pnpm` folder (see explanation here: https://pnpm.io/symlinked-node-modules-structure).

As a result, some libraries that support the new architecture but lack the `ios.codegenConfig.componentProvider` field - like [FlashList](https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list/blob/main/package.json) - will be skipped during Codegen generation.

This PR explicitly includes `.pnpm` to prevent this issue.

## Changelog:

[iOS][Fixed] - Check .pnpm folder when looking for third-party components.

## Test Plan

Tested on:

RN 0.78.0 
PNPM: 10
Flashlist: 1.7.3
