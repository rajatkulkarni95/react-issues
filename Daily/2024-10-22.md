### Type event options as interface instead of objects

> Issue #49204 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49204)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

We don't copy the options object and just access the individual properties, so using an interface is enough, and has the benefit of not having to create object copies to pass down to subclasses.
