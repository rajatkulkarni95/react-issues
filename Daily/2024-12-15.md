### Update podspecs to use the ReactNativeDependencies or build from source (#49812)

> Issue #49968 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49968)

Summary:
Updates all the core podspec to use the new `ReactNativeDependencies` podspec

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL] - Updates Modules in core to use the new dependencies.


Test Plan:
✅ Run Rn-Tester and  verify that it works as expected both building deps from source and using prebuilt tarballs
✅ Add third-party library (react-native-reanimated) and perform the same tests to verify that it works with the changed podspec and utilities

### Remove views from their parent on recycle

> Issue #49851 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49851)

Summary:
Android doesn't allow to mount a view that already has a parent. View recycling removes all children from a view. But if some views don't support recycling, they'll keep a reference to their children. Children being recycled will cause an exception when being mounted.

This diff removes the view from its parent when it is being recycled. This guarantees that whatever the parent, the view can be mounted after being recycled.

### [codegen][Windows] ENOENT error when resolving relative paths with parent directory references

> Issue #49547 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49547)

## Description
When running React Native codegen, the `expandDirectoriesIntoFiles` function in `@react-native/codegen/lib/cli/combine/combine-js-to-schema.js` fails to properly resolve relative paths (e.g., '../src'), resulting in an ENOENT error.

## Environment
- React Native version: [0.77.0]
- Node.js version: [v18.20.6]
- OS: Windows
- @react-native/codegen version: [0.77.0]

## Current Behavior
The function attempts to use `fs.lstatSync` directly on relative paths without resolving them first, causing ENOENT errors when the path includes parent directory references (`../`).

### Error message:

```js
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '..\src'
    at Object.lstatSync (node:fs:1666:3)

  errno: -4058,
  syscall: 'lstat',
  code: 'ENOENT',
  path: '..\\src'
}
```

## Expected Behavior
The function should properly resolve relative paths against the project root before attempting to check if they are directories.

## Proposed Solution
I've implemented a temporary fix using patch-package that resolves relative paths against the project root:

```js
function expandDirectoriesIntoFiles(fileList, platform, exclude) {
  return fileList
    .flatMap(file => {
      try {
        if (!fs.lstatSync(file).isDirectory()) {
          return [file];
        }
      } catch (error) {
        // If the directory doesn't exist, try to resolve it relative to project root
        const projectRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../../..');
        const absolutePath = path.resolve(projectRoot, file.replace('../', ''));
        if (!fs.existsSync(absolutePath)) {
          return [];
        }
        file = absolutePath;
      }
      const filePattern = path.sep === '\\' ? file.replace(/\\/g, '/') : file;
      return glob.sync(`${filePattern}/**/*.{js,ts,tsx}`, {
        nodir: true,
      });
    })
    .filter(element => filterJSFile(element, platform, exclude));
}
```

       const filePattern = path.sep === '\\' ? file.replace(/\\/g, '/') : file;
       return glob.sync(`${filePattern}/**/*.{js,ts,tsx}`, {
```

## Additional Context
This issue particularly affects Windows environments where path resolution behaves differently than on Unix-like systems.

## Steps to Reproduce

Have a React Native project with source files in a parent directory (e.g., '../src')
Run the codegen process
Observe the ENOENT error

### Restore Metro log streaming via CLI flag

> Issue #49353 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49353)

Summary:
This change adds an opt-in to restore JavaScript log streaming via the Metro dev server, [removed from React Native core in 0.77](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/01/21/version-0.77#removal-of-consolelog-streaming-in-metro).

Users can opt into this legacy behaviour by adding the `--client-logs` flag to `npx react-native-community/cli start`.

- The default experience remains without streamed JS logs.
- The existing "JavaScript logs have moved! ..." notice is printed in all cases, and we do not advertise the new flag for new users.
- Under non-Community CLI dev servers (i.e. Expo), log streaming is restored implicitly.

We will clean up this functionality again when we eventually remove JS log streaming over `HMRClient`, tasked in T214991636.

**Implementation notes**

- Logs are always sent over `HMRClient` (previous status quo), even with log streaming off in the dev server. This is a necessary evil to be able to flag this functionality in a user-accessible place, and to move fast for 0.78.
- Necessarily, emitting `fusebox_console_notice` moves to the dev server itself, on first device (Fusebox) connection.

Changelog:
[General][Added] - Add opt in for legacy Metro log streaming via `--client-logs` flag
