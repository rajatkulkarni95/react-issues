### Animated: Avoid Invalidation of Ref Callback

> Issue #50002 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50002)

Summary:
Creates a new feature flag, `avoidAnimatedRefInvalidation`, to experiment with changing `useAnimatedProps`, so that the returned ref callback is no longer invalidated when `props` changes.

When we introduced `useAnimatedPropsMemo` and stabilized `AnimatedProps` (which is only invalidated when `AnimatedValue` and shallow `AnimatedEvent` instances are changed in an update), we should have also made this change. It was an oversight that we did not do this.

Avoiding unnecessary invalidation of the ref callback is important to reduce extra work and unpredictable semantics associated with unnecessary detaching and re-attaching of refs.

### Allow text links to be navigatable via keyboard by default v2

> Issue #49381 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49381)

Summary:
A much improved version of my previous attempt in D68306316 (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/48773).

Instead of LinkMovementMethod which makes TextViews scrollable if they overflow, this implementation uses `ExploreByTouchHelper`'s `onVirtualViewKeyboardFocusChanged` and `onPerformActionForVirtualView` to handle focus changes and clicks on virtual views (aka spans in our case). This impl will correctly ellipsize text and allow tab to nav through the links.
