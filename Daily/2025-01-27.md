### Invariant Violation: ViewPropTypes has been removed from React Native

> Issue #49800 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49800)

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Firstly, thanks for your work on this project! ðŸ™‚

Today I used [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) to patch `react-native@0.70.15` for the project I'm working on.

Invariant Violation: Failed to call into JavaScript module method AppRegistry.runApplication(). Module has not been registered as callable. Registered callable JavaScript modules (n = 10): Systrace, JSTimers, HeapCapture, SamplingProfiler, RCTLog, RCTDeviceEventEmitter, RCTNativeAppEventEmitter, GlobalPerformanceLogger, JSDevSupportModule, HMRClient.
A frequent cause of the error is that the application entry file path is incorrect. This can also happen when the JS bundle is corrupt or there is an early initialization error when loading React Native., js engine: hermes

Here is the diff that solved my problem:

```bash
diff --git a/node_modules/react-native/scripts/.packager.env b/node_modules/react-native/scripts/.packager.env
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..21a13cf
