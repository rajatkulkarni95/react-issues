### [iOS] Fabric: disable  React-Fabric stable_sort strict weak sort check in debug mode

> Issue #49422 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49422)

## Summary:

Fixes assert crash in https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/46568#issuecomment-2653747732. 

We can temporarily downgrade  _LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE to _LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE_EXTENSIVE, it disables strict weak ordering check in debug mode. Actually, when we sort animation mutations, we don't need it to satisfy strict weak ordering. 

https://libcxx.llvm.org/Hardening.html#id3

Another solution is we make sort satisfy it, but we don't have any key to compare when two mutation is the same mutation type but not the same parentTag. Maybe we can use pointer of muation to compare?

## Changelog:

[IOS] [FIXED] - Fabric: disable  React-Fabric stable_sort strict weak sort check in debug mode


## Test Plan:

Fixes  https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/46568#issuecomment-2653747732.
