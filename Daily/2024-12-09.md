### Fix New Arch handling of inline views when text truncated

> Issue #49960 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49960)

Summary:
Fixes  https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49106

RN legacy arch, and web, will clip inline content which appears after elipsized text. This is the correct behavior, compared to new arch, which will put it in a random place depending on the platform.

`line-clamp`: https://jsfiddle.net/7xgdke1b/
`text-overflow`: https://jsfiddle.net/7xgdke1b/2/

Fabric renderer does not, funnily enough, having an `isClipped` field on `TextMeasurement::Attachment` that is never used.

This change propagates state for whether an attachment is beyond elipsized area to this measurement, then when we see it, we set empty layout results with `DisplayType::None` so that we don't create native views. We don't layout child views either, but this seems to work out okay, even when removing and re-adding `numberOfLines`.

### refactor(react-native-codegen): Replace `jscodeshift` with `@babel/core`

> Issue #49641 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49641)

## Summary:

`jscodeshift` is only used in one module (`src/generators/components/GenerateViewConfigJs.js`, but depends on a rather complex dependency chain and has a rather large maintenance burden relative to what it's used for and the value it adds in the codebase.

Since the `GenerateViewConfigJs` module creates simple templates, using `@babel/core` (and implicitly `@babel/template` and `@babel/types`) is a lot simpler and changes little code. The only change this introduces to the output are formatting changes (`singleQuote` and `trailingCommas` options are discarded). The code is otherwise functionally identical.

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL] [CHANGED] - Drop jscodeshift dependency from @react-native/codegen

## Test Plan:

This was tested against a React Native build with the `@react-native/babel-plugin-codegen` plugina active and using the snapshots in the repo itself. While the snapshots have changed in formatting, none of the outputs change the code's AST.

<details>
<summary>
Example output from <code>@react-native/babel-plugin-codegen</code> to supplement the snapshot tests
</summary>

This is the example bundling output of `AndroidSwipeRefreshLayout`. This demonstrates that both the view config output and the `Commands` export continue to be generated correctly.

### move RCTInitializeUIKitProxies to RCTFabricSurface init

> Issue #49541 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49541)

Summary:
changelog: [internal]

`RCTSurfacePresenter` may be initialised from a background thread. This breaks the requirement of `RCTInitializeUIKitProxies`, which must be always called on the main thread.

### keep heartbeat between inspector proxy and debugger going even if not idle

> Issue #49441 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49441)

Summary:
Changelog:
[General][Internal] - keep heartbeat between inspector proxy and debugger going even if not idle

When heartbeat was only used to keep the connection alive and to detect debugger timeouts, it was enough to send a ping every time the connection was idle for 10 seconds.

Now, when we use the heartbeat as a way to track how good is the round trip time between the inspector proxy and the debugger, we would like to make this measurement is more reliable by sending a ping 10 seconds after each pong, even if the connection is not idle.

It also simplifies the code and makes it more clear by removing the confusing `shouldSetTerminateTimeout` variable.

### "could not build module" errors on Xcode 16.2, react native 0.76.6

> Issue #49347 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49347)

### Description

Hello all:) I am using Xcode 16.2, react native 0.76.6, simulator -> iPhone 15(17.0), mac M1 Sequoia 15.2. 
Many "could not build module" errors appear while building modules inside iPhoneSimulator18.2.sdk.

The think is that I don't even use this simulator and if I try to delete it, the Xcode hides all other simulator options and requires 18.2 to download..

Of course I already tried to clean and delete and reinstall everything but nothing works..
Any help is welcome:) Thanks!

### Steps to reproduce

1. Install Xcode 16.2
2. Migrate a react native project from version 0.74.4 to 0.76.6
3. Install on Xcode simulator iPhone15 (17.0)
4. Run build

### React Native Version

0.76.6
