### Emit synthetic Trace Events for non-bridgeless to fix trace representation

> Issue #49729 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49729)

Summary:
# Changelog: [Internal]

The only data source for non-bridgeless setup is JavaScript samples.

Chrome DevTools frontend is built around an assumption that thread should have at least single timeline or user timing event to be represented on a timeline view. They do it for filtering out unnecessary workers threads and other.

We will emit 2 synthetic Trace Events that should cover these requirements and recorded traces that contain only JavaScript samples should now be displayed correctly.

### Remove unused sample turbo cxx module variants

> Issue #49629 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49629)

Summary:
I don't think `RCTSampleTurboCxxModule_v1` does anything useful anymore since we no longer use the `getTurboModuleWithJsInvoker:` API anywhere.

### React-Native Accessibility Focus Order Issues

> Issue #49429 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49429)

### Description

We are performing Accessibility testing in our React native app in iOS using Xcode Accessibility Inspector. We found few issues in focus order during the testing.

- The components are read from left to right and top to bottom by default. We are not able to change the focus order as the components are not read in meaningful order. It could be better if there is a prop to configure the focus order and also it should work across multiple components shown in the same screen.
- Focus is not staying on the triggered elements when a Modal/Keyboard/Drodown is closed. Instead, it is moving to the top of the screen. Ideally, the focus should stay and continue from the same element.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open Xcode accessibility inspector and try to inspect any RN iOS app.
2. The components are traversed left to right and top to bottom.
3. Open a modal using a button. Once the modal is closed, the focus is not returning to the triggered button. But it is reading from the first element of the screen.

### Configure all feature flags of NewArchitecture on canary

> Issue #49333 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49333)

Summary:
The rollout of "new architecture everywhere" should be enabled in OSS canary releases. This diff updates the ReactNativeFeatureFlags.config.js to reflect that all of the feature flags used by the new architecture are enabled by default in experimental and canary releases. Note that these feature flags were already enabled in OSS when new architecture was enabled.

### [0.76] WebSocket (MQTT) connection does not emit ‘offline’ event when the app goes to the background

> Issue #49243 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49243)

### Description

In React Native 0.73, WebSocket-based MQTT connections worked correctly in the background.
When the app moved to the background, the connection eventually dropped, and the offline event was emitted.

However, after updating to React Native 0.76, the offline event is not emitted, and the MQTT connection is not automatically closed when the app moves to the background.

Possible Causes:
	•	The behavior of setImmediate has changed, affecting WebSocket execution in the background.
	•	The introduction of queueReactNativeMicrotask (starting from RN 0.74) may have affected this behavior.

### Steps to reproduce

	1.	Set up react-native-mqtt (or WebSocket-based MQTT) in a React Native 0.76 environment.
	2.	Start the app and establish a WebSocket connection.
	3.	Use AppState.addEventListener("change", callback) to track app state changes.
	4.	Move the app to the background.
	5.	The offline event does not fire.

### React Native Version

0.76.0

import MQTT from 'react-native-mqtt';

const options = {
  host: 'broker.hivemq.com',
  port: 1883,
  clientId: 'test-client',
  keepalive: 60,
};

const client = MQTT.createClient(options);

client.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('MQTT Connected');
});

client.on('offline', () => {
  console.log('MQTT Disconnected'); // ✅ This works in RN 0.73, but NOT in RN 0.76
});

client.connect();
```

	• This worked correctly in React Native 0.73.
	• After updating to 0.76, Hermes might be handling setImmediate differently.
	• The introduction of queueReactNativeMicrotask in RN 0.74 might have changed how WebSocket runs in the background.
