### [0.77][Needs repro] Unable to launch React Native DevTools in newly upgraded app

> Issue #49287 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49287)

### Description

No info in console. Eventually I get the following error:

Failed to open debugger for com.bevnote.somm725 (iPhone 16 Pro) (React Native Bridgeless [C++ connection]): fetch failed

RN Debugger worked in 0.76.2 before I upgraded. When I try to access it via 'd' in android I get:

 INFO  Opening Dev Menu...
 INFO  Launching DevTools...
 WARN  No compatible apps connected. React Native DevTools can only be used with the Hermes engine.


### Steps to reproduce

1. yarn start
2. yarn iOS / yarn android
3. 'j' / 'd'

### React Native Version

0.77.0
