### Use implicit namespace to better align Animated module with OSS types

> Issue #49559 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49559)

Summary:
## Motivation
Modernising the RN codebase to allow for modern Flow tooling to process it.

## This diff
Renames `Animated.js` to `AnimatedExports.js`, and introduces an intermediate file that reexports `* as Animated` as a default. This should have equivalent runtime behavior, but allows for a common interface file: `Animated.js.flow` to reinterpret the module as having single exports. TypeScript treats this as a namespace.
