### Experimental pointer events conflicting with bottom-sheet gestures

> Issue #50024 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/50024)

### Description

When experimental pointer events are enabled (https://reactnative.dev/blog/2022/12/13/pointer-events-in-react-native#enable-feature-flags) and a bottom-sheet is closed via touch gestures (https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet) the pointer events stop working. (issue happens on both Android and iOS)

Honestly not sure where is the issue between 
- react-native experimental pointer events
- react-native-gesture-handler
- the bottom sheet implementation

But maybe you may have some ideas and eventually direct me to culprit.

Thanks.

### Steps to reproduce

1. yarn && yarn android && yarn start
2. pressing the "press me" pressable increases both the counters for `onPressIn` as well as `onPointerDown` events
3. close the bottom sheet by dragging the handle or the content of the sheet
4. now pressing "press me" only increases press events, no pointer events are emitted anymore

Note: if the sheet is close with the "close" button, then the issue does not occur

### Inline Task.call without Executor

> Issue #49906 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49906)

Summary:
Task.call is equivalent to a try-catch and wrapping the result in a Task. Inlining this is cheaper than creating a TaskCompletionSource and a Runnable.

### Provide access to document object in Fantom roots

> Issue #49691 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49691)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

This adds a new getter for `document` in the `Root` class in Fantom tests to easily access the document instance for the root.

This isn't very useful at the moment, but will be very useful when we introduce `document.getElementById`, so we can access arbitrary nodes very easily.
