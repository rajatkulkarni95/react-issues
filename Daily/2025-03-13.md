### Correctly batch reportMount calls

> Issue #50090 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50090)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

I refactored `FabricUIManager` in D54547194 / https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/43337 and accidentally removed setting this flag to avoid scheduling redundant tasks in the UI thread to report mount. This fixes it.
