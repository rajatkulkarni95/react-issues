### React native hermes bundle with plain text warnings

> Issue #49410 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49410)

1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
2. Assemble the bundle with `cd android && ./gradlew bundleRelease`
3. Preview the bundle on `/android/app/build/generated/assets/createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets`
4. Verify that queries and mutations are there in plain text

Add a flag which we will use to prefer Fabric CSS parser to ViewConfig processors. We will use this to experiment on iOS, where we are using Fabric props (until Props 2.0 for Android).

### Update multi-platform handling in build-types, add debug logs

> Issue #49224 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49224)

Summary:
Refactor / quality pass.

- Remove `micromatch`, replace with glob ignores.
- Move and simplify platfom-specific file logic: mutate `files` as a single `Set`, reduce iterations.
    - This is reconfigured so that the input file path globs need only match `*.js` sources.
- Introduce `debug` logs and expose convenience `--debug` script flag.
- Move output error detection into inner function implementation.
