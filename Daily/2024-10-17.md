### [RN][iOS][0.77] Properly handle null values in the TMInterop layer

> Issue #49291 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49291)

## Summary:
This PR targets `0.78-stable` and it mimics this other PR on `main` https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49250

The original PR has not landed in `main` yet, but we need it if we want to prepare a golden release candidate.

The problem we are seeing is that some legacy module were passing null values from JS to Native and the null value was used in native to make business logic decisions.

In the New Architecture, null values passed down from JS to Native are stripped out and native does not receive them.
This break some Legacy Libraries that are not migrated to the New Architecture yet.

This change fixes this problem and properly forward null values to modules working throught the interop layer.

## Changelog:
[iOS][Fixed] - Properly handle null value in TurboModule Interop layer.

## Test Plan:
Tested in a reproducer provided by the community.
All internal tests on the mentioned PR on main are green.
