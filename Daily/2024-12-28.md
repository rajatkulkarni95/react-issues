### ] Fix crashes in MutationObserver caused by commit hooks in main thread

> Issue #49981 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49981)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

(because MutationObserver isn't a public API yet)

## Context

`MutationObserver` is a [JavaScript API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) used to report mutations in the DOM tree. The mutations available on Web are: changing children, changing attributes and changing text. In React Native, only changing children is supported.

Mutation detection needs to happen synchronously when mutations happen (in ShadowTree commits) and the notification is dispatched as a microtask in JS, which means we can only report mutations happening in JavaScript.

There's an assumption that only React (in JS) can change the structure of the tree in Fabric, so we implemented `MutationObserver` considering this assummption.

Unfortunately, while the assumption is correct (we can only mutate children from React) the implementation didn't take into account that commit hooks were triggered from multiple threads, even if the structure doesn't change (e.g.: with Fabric state updates). In this case, we do the checks but we never dispatch the notifications. This can cause crashes (see T217617393) if we try to check for mutations from the main thread while we add new observers in the JS thread (because that logic wasn't thread safe).

This fixes that crash by, in MutationObserver, not only preventing notifications from commits not coming from React, but also preventing the determination altogether.

In order to do this, this modifies the signature of the commit hooks to also pass the commit options, and adds a new field in the commit options with the source of the commit (for now, just "React" or "Unknown").

In `MutationObserver`, before accessing the data structures of the observer, we check if the commit is coming from React, and return early otherwise.
