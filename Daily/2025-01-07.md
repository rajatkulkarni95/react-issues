### attempt to fix nightly by bumping nexus-publish

> Issue #49778 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49778)


## Summary:

This PR attempts to fix nightly release by bumping nexus-publish to 2.0.0.

The issue: 

```
* What went wrong:
Configuration cache problems found in this build.

5 problems were found storing the configuration cache, 2 of which seem unique.
- Task `:initializeSonatypeStagingRepository` of type `io.github.gradlenexus.publishplugin.InitializeNexusStagingRepository`: cannot serialize object of type 'org.gradle.api.DefaultTask', a subtype of 'org.gradle.api.Task', as these are not supported with the configuration cache.
  See https://docs.gradle.org/8.13/userguide/configuration_cache.html#config_cache:requirements:task_access
- Task `:initializeSonatypeStagingRepository` of type `io.github.gradlenexus.publishplugin.InitializeNexusStagingRepository`: cannot serialize object of type 'org.gradle.api.internal.project.DefaultProject', a subtype of 'org.gradle.api.Project', as these are not supported with the configuration cache.
  See https://docs.gradle.org/8.13/userguide/configuration_cache.html#config_cache:requirements:disallowed_types
```

The release notes mention: "improve support for build cache and compatibility with Gradle 8.x" 

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL] [FIXED] - bump nexus-publish to 2.0.0


## Test Plan:

CI Green

### Move text-specific a11y logic in ReactAccessibilityDelegate to subclass

> Issue #49377 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49377)

Summary:
ReactAccessibilityDelegate exists to handle much of the accessibility tasks in the various Views in RN. There is quite a bit of text specific logic, mostly related to virtual views and nested links within a TextView. 

I decided to subclass this into a TextView-specific version because I need this delegate to reference TextView or ReactClickableSpan, which live under `react/views` while ReactAccessibilityDelegate live under `react/uimanager`. The former depends on the latter, so making the latter depend on the former would for a dependency cycle that would break builds. I thought about making a separate package for this but both `react/views` and `react/uimanager` need to include ReactAccessibilityDelegate so we would still have a cycle.

mAccessibilityLinks is only set on ReactTextViewManager, so this is purely a text thing. Subclassing is not the most ideal as it extends the inheritance chain some more but I do not see a better option.
