### `extraModulesForBridge` not called with new architecture enabled in RN 0.78

> Issue #49819 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49819)

### Description

### Problem

While upgrading to the new architecture, I'm not seeing the `extraModulesForBridge` being called at all, even:

- when implemented in the AppDelegate (which extends from `RCTAppDelegate`), or
- when using the new `RCTReactNativeFactory` constructor and passing down a delegate that implements the `extraModulesForBridge`

### Investigation

In runtime, the instance of `_appTMMDelegate` is [RCTReactNativeFactory](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/v0.78.0/packages/react-native/Libraries/AppDelegate/RCTReactNativeFactory.mm), which does not respond to the `extraModulesForBridge` selector. As a result, conditional check is always returning `false`, which explains the bug.

#### Wasn't that working before?

This was a legitimate issue before, which https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/47693 intended to fix by adding the code above. That PR delegated the `extraModules` selector handling to the `_appTMMDelegate`.

Previously, the class that conformed to the `RCTTurboModuleManagerDelegate` protocol was `RCTAppDelegate` ([see the implementation at that point here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/12982fe9fa0e694517b988c6ea69c68758cb2a33/packages/react-native/Libraries/AppDelegate/RCTAppDelegate.mm#L207)).

For that reason, we could pass down that instance as part of `initWithTurboModuleDelegate:self`:

```objc
return [[RCTRootViewFactory alloc] initWithTurboModuleDelegate:self hostDelegate:self configuration:configuration];
```

This setup allowed the `AppDelegate` to function correctly as long as it extended from `RCTAppDelegate` and implemented `extraModulesForBridge`.

#### When did this regressed?

The situation changed with https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/46298 , which ported the logic as-is from `RCTAppDelegate` to `RCTReactNativeFactory`. 

`RCTReactNativeFactory` has a delegate (either the soon to be legacy `RCTAppDelegate`, or the new `RCTReactNativeFactoryDelegate`) that _can_ handle that selector, but `RCTReactNativeFactory` itself does not implement that `extraModulesForBridge`, so the fix introduced in the previous PR will always return `false`!

#### Potential workaround

I was able to fix locally by adding this to `RCTReactNativeFactory` implementation:

```objc
- (NSArray<id<RCTBridgeModule>> *)extraModulesForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge {
    if ([_delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(extraModulesForBridge:)]) {
        return [_delegate extraModulesForBridge:bridge];
    }
    return @[];
}
```



### Steps to reproduce

1. Run the iOS application (i.e. `yarn react-native run-ios`)
2. Notice that the screen displays "Extra modules not called" in red. You can debug to verify that is needed happening because `extraModules:for:` is never being called.
