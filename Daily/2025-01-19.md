### Fix documentElement methods for element not working correctly

> Issue #49898 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49898)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

In the method to access the native node reference from elements, we weren't considering the case where the element is the `documentElement`, which is a special case we were handling correctly in the case of native node references from nodes (where we also handle it possibly being a document node).

Because of this, methods in `Element` and `ReactNativeElement` weren't working correctly on the `documentElement`. We didn't catch this initially because we only tested the traversal methods defined in node in the test for `ReactNativeDocument`.

This fixes the issue.

### Migrate `ProgressRequestBody` to Kotlin

> Issue #49682 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49682)

## Summary:

Migrate com.facebook.react.modules.network.ProgressRequestBody to Kotlin.

Note: To keep the logic the same as in Java, I had to make the params of RequestBodyUtil.createProgressRequest non-nullable again which were made nullable by mistake in https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49584.

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL]- Migrate com.facebook.react.modules.network.ProgressRequestBody to Kotlin

## Test Plan:

```bash
yarn test-android
yarn android

### accessibleElements impl on iOS

> Issue #49582 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49582)

Differential Revision: D69625269

TSIA, this is a fairly straightforward implementation since iOS likes the shape the data is already in. Note I form a stacking context since I need the native view that has accessibilityElements to actually be an ancestor of everything under it

Note I am not exposing anything yet on the JS side, since we need to do Android also

### feat: js runtime switching C API for Swift

> Issue #49489 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49489)

## Summary:

> [!NOTE] 
> This PR is part of JavaScriptCore Extraction to this repository: https://github.com/react-native-community/javascriptcore

This PR implements a C API to switch JS Engines that can be used from Swift.

Here is an example:

```swift
import React
import React_RCTAppDelegate
import ReactAppDependencyProvider
import UIKit
import RCTRuntime

class ReactNativeDelegate: RCTDefaultReactNativeFactoryDelegate {
  override func sourceURL(for bridge: RCTBridge) -> URL? {
    self.bundleURL()
  }

  override func bundleURL() -> URL? {
    #if DEBUG
    RCTBundleURLProvider.sharedSettings().jsBundleURL(forBundleRoot: "index")
    #else
    Bundle.main.url(forResource: "main", withExtension: "jsbundle")
    #endif
  }

  override func createJSRuntimeFactory() -> JSRuntimeFactory {
    jsrt_create_jsc_factory() // Easily switch engines here
  }
}
```


## Changelog:

[IOS] [ADDED] -  js runtime C API for Swift

## Test Plan:

CI Green
