### Suppress deprecation error in ProgressResponseBody to fix build-android

> Issue #49953 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49953)

## Summary:

The `build-android` action started failing after merging the ProgressResponseBody migration to Kotlin in bf7a0e57989fd7db5530d8a44a63cf1d25f38165. This is most likely caused because of the usage of different libs versions in OSS (Okio in this case) – we just need to suppress the deprecation error as we are doing for similar classes.

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL] - Add Suppress("DEPRECATION_ERROR") in ProgressResponseBody to fix `build-android`

## Test Plan:

```
yarn build-android
```
