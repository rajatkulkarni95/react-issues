### [RN][iOS] Avoid the creation of separate folders for separate artifacts

> Issue #49760 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49760)

## Summary:
When downloading artifacts using a pattern, GHA, by default, creates a folder for each artifacts and copies the artifacts in that folder.
This breaks the maven publishing which expects the artifacts in the `artifact` folder and not i a subfolder.

The `merge-multiple` option allow for the artifacts to be downloaded in the specified folder, without the extra folder in the path

## Changelog:
[Internal] - Avoid the creation of intermediate folder when downloading the artifacts

## Test Plan:
GHA

### chore(dev-middleware): Move `selfsigned` to `package.json:devDependencies`

> Issue #49556 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49556)

## Summary:

This package does not seem to be referenced by anything but the tests in `packages/dev-middleware`, so seems like a pretty straightforward change to drop it from `dependencies`.

It only seems to be referenced in `packages/dev-middleware/src/__tests__/ServerUtils.js`

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL] [CHANGED] - Remove selfsigned from dev-middleware dependencies

## Test Plan:

- n/a

### Remove index.js.flow shim from Node packages

> Issue #49461 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49461)

Summary:
Flow now supports Package Exports ðŸŽ‰. This means we can delete the compatiblity pattern in each of our build-enabled Node.js packages.

This simplifies the internal package structure needed to support Flow while developing from source in the monorepo â€” no prod impact.
