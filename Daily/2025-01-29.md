### Overwrite betterHitTest in RCTScrollViewComponentView instead of changing layout metrics of the container view

> Issue #50027 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50027)

Summary:
Changelog: [IOS][CHANGED] - Overwrite betterHitTest in RCTScrollViewComponentView instead of changing layout metrics of the container view

## Summary:

In https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49855 I changed the container view of `RCTScrollViewComponentView` to be `RCTViewComponentView` instead of `UIView` so the touches would bass through its `betterHitTest` implementation (along with udating its layout metrics so the right path in the function is chosen). This resulted in some issues and the alternative approach of customizing the hit testing of the ScrollView itself might be a better approach.

This PR changes overwrites the `betterHitTest` method in a way that the `containerView` is entirely skipped during hit testing, instead forwarding the call to its children. This way, it won't prevent touches outside its frame from being delivered to children that extend out of the frame.

### Migrate `JavaScriptContextHolder` & `JavaScriptExecutor` to Kotlin

> Issue #49909 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49909)

## Summary:

Migrate com.facebook.react.bridge JavaScriptContextHolder & JavaScriptExecutor to Kotlin.

In this PR I also marked the return of HermesExecutor.initHybridDefaultConfig as non-nullable to keep the conversion without logic changes. I checked that this was changed unintentionally to nullable in 12e321daf07d312c6b4947e306a449a7985ac19a but I think it was not supposed to be.

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL] - Migrate com.facebook.react.bridge JavaScriptContextHolder & JavaScriptExecutor to Kotlin

## Test Plan:

```bash
yarn test-android
yarn android
```

 <KeyboardAvoidingView
      behavior={'padding'}
      // behavior={Platform.OS == 'ios' ? 'padding' : 'padding'}
      keyboardVerticalOffset={keyboardStatus ? 250 : 0} // 调整这个值
      style={styles.container}>
 <TextInput
    style={styles.input}

### Fix `onContentSizeChange` being dispatched too often on iOS

> Issue #49695 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49695)

## Summary:

Solves the iOS part of #47186.

`onContentSizeChanged` event is sent inside the `updateLayoutMetrics` method every time it's invoked. A change in layout metrics doesn't mean that the content size also changes, like changing the position of the input.

This PR adds a condition that the content size must have changed before sending the event.

|Before this change|After this change|
|-|-|
|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/743e1502-e13e-474e-b4a6-ef6873bf9619">|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe3d3ef5-3951-4ba2-b9a1-c41439ab455c">|

In the reproducer from the issue, `SafeAreaView` is used, which at first renders its content without any insets until its state is updated with the correct insets. Both of these layouts change the layout metrics of the text input, resulting in two events before this change and a single one after.

## Changelog:

[IOS] [FIXED] - Fixed TextInput's `onContentSizeChange` event being dispatched multiple times with the same size

## Test Plan:

Tested on the reproducer from the issue
