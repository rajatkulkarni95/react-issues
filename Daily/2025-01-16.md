### introduce convenience method Fantom.scrollTo

> Issue #50011 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50011)

Summary:
changelog: [internal]

Majority of time, you want to simply scroll. This diff introduces a convenience method Fantom.scrollTo.

Previously, you would have to write:
```
  Fantom.runOnUIThread(() => {
    Fantom.enqueueScrollEvent(element, {
      x: 0,
      y: 60,
    });
  });
  Fantom.runWorkLoop();
```

Now, you can just do:
```
 Fantom.scrollTo(element, {
    x: 0,
    y: 60,
  });
```

### Update lockfile @babel/ dependencies, regenerate Flow types, unbreak Meta-internal test

> Issue #49894 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49894)

Summary:
Update `babel` entries in `yarn.lock` and run:

`yarn update-babel-flow-lib-defs` 

...from Metro, to regenerate our Flow definitions from Babel source, then sync to RN.

Changelog: [Internal]

Facebook
D70778791 updated some `xplat/js/yarn.lock` Babel entries, which caused `xplat/js/tools/metro/scripts/__tests__/babel-lib-defs-test.js` to start failing only when Yarn had *not* been run in `xplat/js/tools/metro`, because the hoisted `xplat/js` Babel deps were a greater version than the locked `xplat/js/tools/metro` Babel deps.

This realigns them and updates the types to unbreak the test both internally an in OSS.

### Setup a Macrobenchmark for RNTester

<!-- Thanks for submitting a pull request! We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory. -->

## Summary:

Benchmark to test changes from #49449

Might be nice to have some version of this in the repo.

## Changelog:

[INTERNAL] [ADDED] - Setup a Macrobenchmark for RNTester

## Test Plan:

### Methodology

Picked various JS file from websites (facebook, instagram) to artificially grow RN tester bundle somewhat realistically. The files are required lazily from a button press callback to simulate the code being included, but not executed, as it would be in a large app that uses lazy requires for the different screens.

I've also made the RN tester screens lazy so all their code is not loaded initially. This is more representative of real apps. Note this is implemented in a hacky way just for the purpose of this test. It would actually be nice to implement this properly.

The tests were made using low end device Samsung Galaxy A03s.
