### chore(react-native-codegen): Remove fixtures and outdated transforms from build output

> Issue #49916 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49916)

## Summary:

- Update ignore micromatch pattern to filter out `__test_fixtures__` from build output
- Remove `@babel/plugin-transform-object-rest-spread`
- Remove `@babel/plugin-transform-async-to-generator`
- Remove `@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring`

The `package.json:engines:node` field is already set to `>=18` which makes the three Babel transforms that were removed redundant.

[INTERNAL] [CHANGED] - Remove fixtures files and outdated Babel transforms from `@react-native/codegen` build output

## Test Plan:

- Ran against Node 18

### Back out D69855097 & D69874923 to unblock Twilight headset pairing/discovery

> Issue #49600 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49600)

Summary:
# Context
Recent reports of unable to pair or connect to headsets in the Twilight app started ~1 day ago.

I used a bisect to narrow down the range of changes https://www.internalfb.com/mobile-bisect/Bi653128483872339, which lead to [changelog](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/changelog/?search=%7B%22key%22%3A%22AND%22%2C%22children%22%3A[%7B%22key%22%3A%22buck_target_is%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22buck_target%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22%2F%2Ffbobjc%2FApps%2FOculus%2FTwilight%3ATwilight%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22branch_first%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22branch%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22master%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22revision_first%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22revision%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22e835199c51fd1b55c3c13c5504f9b5527e201b41%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22branch_last%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22branch%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22master%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22revision_last%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22revision%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22d19e5a6cd5949d65aee30f7e8ce185979b7448af%22%7D]%7D)

From there I continued until I found the threshold
D69855097 (bad) and D69803512 (good).

I tried a direct revert of D69855097 but the changes we spread across another diff
D69874923.

Reverting the stack of these gets us to here.

Could use help understanding what's going on.
