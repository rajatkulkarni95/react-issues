### Refactor tracing in performance.mark and performance.measure

> Issue #49639 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49639)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

This refactors some code in the performance API and Perfetto to avoid doing unnecessary work when not tracing (e.g.: string manipulation for tracks).

It also reduces the cost of logging marks/measures to tracing backends if not actively tracing (e.g.: moving the check to outside the lock).

### Gradle Configuration Cache - Round 3

> Issue #49439 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49439)

Summary:
This is the next part of a series of diff needed to enable G. Configuration Cache:
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html
as it will make our CI faster (and will be the default in the future Gradle version).

Here I'm removing the `onlyIf` lambdas to make some tasks CC friendly.

The problem is that some `onlyIf` lambdas can't easily be serialized. Here I'm cleaning up
the problematic one to move the condition checks at execution time

### Rename dispatchNativeEvent as enqueueNativeEvent

> Issue #49253 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49253)

Summary:
Changelog: [internal]

Renaming this low level method as `enqueue` is more accurate in this case than `dispatch`, which is misleading because it actually doesn't dispatch it to JS.

We should also rename this in Fabric, but that's a larger and breaking change, so just making the change in Fantom for now.
