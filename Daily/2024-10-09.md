### Implement sampling profile serializer

> Issue #49191 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49191)

Summary:
# Changelog: [Internal]

In this diff we are adding another serializer, that will receive local sampling profile (in tracing domain), and will record corresponding Trace Events with `PerformanceTracer`.

It encapsulates the logic of transforming list of samples to `"Profile"` and `"ProfileChunk"` trace events, which will be parsed by Chrome DevTools later.
