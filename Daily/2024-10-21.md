### Improve error log for failed open-debugger fetch

> Issue #49295 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49295)

Summary:
Motivated by https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49287.

This improves on the less useful output of "fetch failed" currently. We expect failing to make a request to the dev server (made from the dev server!) to be a rare edge case, in which case we want to log as much info as possible.

Changelog: [Internal]
