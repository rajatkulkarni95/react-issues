### Deprecate RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED

> Issue #49924 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49924)

Summary:
This change deprecates the RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLEd flag to toggle the New Architecture.

The new approach bring iOS closer to Android: to diasable the New Architecture, user needs to modify the App's Info.plist and add a `RCTNewArchEnabled` boolean entry and set it to `NO`.

The absence of the entry implies that the New Arch is enabled. (Defaults to enabled)

This also deprecates the `RCTSetNewArchEnabled` function because it makes no sense now

## Context
The RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLE flag is a compile time flag we used for almost two years to configure the iOS apps and to determine whether the app should build with the New Arch or not.

However, given that we are looking into prebuilding React Native, we have to get rid of all the compilation flags, because they would require us to prebuild a combinatorial number of artifacts for react native. For example:

- New Arch / Hermes
- Old Arch / Hermes
- New Arch / JSC
- Old Arch / JSC
- ...

## Backward compatibility
We are going to keep adding the RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED flag in all the dependencies, through the cocoapods inrastructure, so libraries, which are not prebuilt, will be build for the right architecture by the app itself.

## Changelog:
[iOS][Deprecated] - deprecate the `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED` and the `RCTSetNewArchEnabled`

> Issue #49816 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49816)

Summary:
Previously, we had different versions of "debug" installed in different packages, mostly because of messed up `yarn.lock` entries.

Also, updated the package, receiving some performance improvements (no relevant breaking changes).

## Changelog:

[ANDROID] [CHANGED] - Add a build time JSC lean core warning

## Test Plan:

- test on rn-tester. rn-tester has a jsc build variant. it shows the warning anyway. commenting out `enableHermesOnlyInVariants` will suppress the warning.
