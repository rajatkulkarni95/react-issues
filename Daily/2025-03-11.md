### Fix 49958: Close a view leak due to lossy onAnimationEnd callback

> Issue #49959 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49959)

## Summary:

Android's onAnimationEnd callback is lossy and ocasionally just does not fire.  However the LayoutAnimationController maintains a sparse array of animations (with Strong View refs) that is only cleaned when the onAnimationEnd callback is invoked.  This results in a leak of Android View objects over time.

To avoid this, the Strong View refs are migrated to WeakReference's and the associated sparse array is cleaned of any invalid layout animations in response to the reset() call.

This closes two leaks:
1. Unbound growth in LayoutAnimationController::mLayoutHandlers
2. Pinning View objects into memory as the sole remaining GC root

## Changelog:

1. Made OpacityAnimation and PositionAndSizeAnimation classes hold weak refs to views only
2. Added a method to LayoutHandlingAnimation to surface if their view ref is gone
3. Added cleanup for Animation with bad view refs

Pick one each for the category and type tags:

[ANDROID] [Fixed]- Fixes memory leak

## Test Plan
* Primarily code inspection and regression given the intermittent nature of Android's failure to execute the callback.
