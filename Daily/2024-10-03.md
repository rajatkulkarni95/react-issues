### Animated: Avoid In-Band State Update

> Issue #49184 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49184)

Summary:
NOTE: **This is an RFC.** After getting some more eyes on this, I plan to put it behind a feature flag for production validation.

D65645985 shipped a refactor to `Animated`, so that it would use a custom `useAnimatedPropsMemo` instead of `useMemo`. This significantly improved update performance by no longer invalidating the `AnimatedProps` on effectively every update to `Animated` components.

However, this was measured to increase memory usage. After a few experiments, we identified that use of the in-band state update was responsible for the memory regression. While this requires further root cause investigation, this diff attempts to mitigate the memory regression.

The implementation strives to minimize duplicated work, such as unnecessarily computing `compositeKey` or creating new instances of `AnimatedProps`. In addition, this implementation strives to do so without significantly degrading when an update is interrupted by a concurrent update.

Changelog:
[General][Changed] - Introduced a feature flag to test an optimization in `Animated` to reduce memory usage.

Differential Revision: D69135223
