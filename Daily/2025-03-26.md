Okay a weird thing is happening at least on windows. Where typing somethings has the cursor going backwards or changing it.

I suspect it’s the cursor storage?? [[Daily/Weekly/2025-W10]]

Does this happen on Mac? No.

Weird, that it would consistently happen on windows. Weirdly nothing seems to have changed in the `useEditor` thing. :(
