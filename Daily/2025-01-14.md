### [0.79] Update Metro to ^0.82.0

> Issue #49892 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49892)

## Summary:

Effectively picks: 
1. https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49885
2. https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49780

(1) Updates all `metro*` dependencies to the latest `^0.82.0`.

The breaking changes in this release apply only to frameworks and integrators.

This update brings `package.json#exports` resolution enabled by default, and lazy hashing for much faster Metro startup.

Release notes:
https://github.com/facebook/metro/releases/tag/v0.82.0

(2) Is the new recommended config for `unstable_conditionNames` for Metro >=0.81.3 - we don't always assert `require` and `import` in every resolution, Metro now implicitly asserts `import` OR `require` depending on the the way the dependency is declared in the source file.

Changelog:
[General][Changed] Update Metro to ^0.82.0

## Test plan
As in `main`

### Add support for Gradle Configuration caching

> Issue #49484 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49484)

Summary:
This is the last diff to add support for Gradle Configuration caching.
The last missing part here was the execution of the `config` command during Gradle configuration time.
Using Java processes API is not supported as the correct way to do external commands that are CC-friendly
is through the `.providers.exec` API which I'm using here.

Closes https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/45154

Changelog:
[Android] [Added] - Add support for Gradle Configuration caching

Differential Revision: D69753889

### fix Modal crash when calling syncSystemBarsVisibility()

> Issue #49386 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49386)

Summary:
It appears that `currentActivity.decorView` sometime is not attached to a window during the process of creating a Dialog for currently unknown reasons causing a crash.
Add check to skip call to `syncSystemBarsVisibility()` in such case as current code cannot function without valid RootWindowInsets.

Changelog:
[Android][Fixed] - fixed crash with Modal when trying to call syncSystemBarsVisibility()

Differential Revision: D69578581
