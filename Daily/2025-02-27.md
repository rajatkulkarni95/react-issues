### Add option for deterministic Animated batching on iOS

> Issue #49942 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49942)

Summary:
iOS flushes NativeAnimated operations to the UI thread in one of two ways:
1. Some operations flush immediately when the operation is queued, namely startAnimation, stopAnimation, and setValue.
2. Other operations rely on flushing from one of the previous operation types, or a UIManager mount callback.

This behavior leads to non-determinism in flushing of some operations like `setOffset` or `startListeningToAnimatedNodeValue`, where if these operations are created, out-of-band from "flushed" operations, they will not take affect until the next React commit.

This change wires up the `animatedShouldSignalBatch` feature flag to queue operations on the JS thread, and flush them after `NativeAnimated.finishOperationBatch` is called.
