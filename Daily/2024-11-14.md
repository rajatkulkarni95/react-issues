### initialise member variable in RCTWindowSafeAreaProxy startObservingSafeArea to prevent potential race

> Issue #49515 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49515)

Summary:
changelog: [internal]


_currentSafeAreaInsets should be initialised as part of `startObservingSafeArea` to make sure it is set before accessed.

Even though, right now _currentSafeAreaInsets is always set before it is read because notification RCTUserInterfaceStyleDidChangeNotification fires eagerly, it might change in the future and introduce a bug.
