### RN: Avoid Rejections in `InteractionManagerStub`

> Issue #49241 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49241)

Summary:
In auditing differences between `InteractionManager` and `InteractionManagerStub` (used to evaluate to entirely remove the former all together), I noticed a behavioral disparity with how errors are handled.

In `InteractionManager`, the promise that's returned is never rejected, whereas `InteractionManagerStub` propagates errors by rejecting the promise that's returned. This changes `InteractionManagerStub` to behave like `InteractionManager` for the purpose of comparing apples-to-apples.
