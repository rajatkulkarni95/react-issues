### Fix issue with zIndex child removal

> Issue #49900 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49900)

Summary:
This appears to fix an issue where removing a sibling with zIndex breaks drawing of the next sibling. The theory is that eager return in `onViewRemoved` prevents the view from reverting into a state where it no longer uses custom draw order. However, tracing back history, this eager return was added to fix a bug in Reanimated (see https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/43389). cc @bartlomiejbloniarz to confirm if [this Reanimated issue](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/issues/5715) resurfaces from this change.

Fixes #49838

### Do not use `$` in identifiers for event emitters.

> Issue #49792 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49792)

Summary:
This removes the `$` from the `event` and `payload` identifier inside codegen.
This is causing the `-Wdollar-in-identifier-extension` warning to fire.

As I'm looking into enabling `-Wall -Werror` for React Common, this should be addressed as well.

### (reattempt) Use implicit namespace to better align Animated module with OSS types

> Issue #49685 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49685)

Summary:
## Motivation
Modernising the RN codebase to allow for modern Flow tooling to process it.

## This diff
Renames `Animated.js` to `AnimatedExports.js`, and introduces an intermediate file that reexports `* as Animated` as a default. This should have equivalent runtime behavior, but allows for a common interface file: `Animated.js.flow` to reinterpret the module as having single exports. TypeScript treats this as a namespace.
