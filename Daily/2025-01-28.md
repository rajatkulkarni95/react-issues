### Switch component incorrectly renders as toggled on even though value prop is hardcoded to false

> Issue #50026 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/50026)

### Description

Given the provided reproduction with Expo Go, the Switch component renders as turned on when toggled, even though the onValueChange handler sets the state to false, and the `value` prop is hardcoded to `false`.

### Steps to reproduce

Follow the provided Expo Snack, choose "My Device" and scan the QR code.
https://snack.expo.dev/@nathan.l.kramer/ranting-indigo-salsa

Once loaded, tap the Switch component. Notice that it toggles to On, despite me never setting the `value` prop to true (it is hardcoded to false).

This is a more extreme version of the bug that is plagueing me where I am using the `isEnabled` state as the `value` prop, and despite never setting it to true the switch renders as toggled on in the same way.

The intention of the snack is to emulate an asynchronous request that returns false for some reason, indicating that the toggle could not be turned on. The behaviour currently turns it on anyway.

NOTE: The issue *does not* reproduce in the web mode of the Expo Snack.

### React Native Debugger Issue in Android

> Issue #49801 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49801)

### Description

I am facing issue in debugging in React Native 0.78. When I pressed J in metro console and open the iOS debugger that is working fine. But when I open the Android debugger I am getting this issue.

The current JavaScript engine, <JSCRuntime@0xb400007282bb3890>, does not support debugging over the Chrome DevTools Protocol. See https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging for more information.

Can anyone give me solution of this problem?

1. Install the app with “npx react-native run-android”
2. Press J to open the debugger
3. Nothing is showing for debugging getting this message
