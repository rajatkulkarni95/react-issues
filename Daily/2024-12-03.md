### Fix Sonatype publishing

> Issue #49836 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49836)

Summary:
We were passing the path to the `RegularFile` instead of the `PublishingArtifacts` to the gradle script.

cortinico why this is not checked at build time? This should be a typing issue that should be caught at build time, also during the test-all jobs, not just when the nightly run...

### (feature) Better style support for text on native

> Issue #49736 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49736)

### Description

Compared to `View`, `<Text />` has extremely limited styling capabilities. These all have issues / don't work at all:

- `borderRadius`
- `padding`
- `height: 100%`
- `width: 100%`
- `flexGrow`
- `flexBasis`
- `justifyContent`
- `alignItems`

The list goes on. I wonder if this is a fundamental limitation of `NativeTextComponent` or if it could be fixed by forwarding more styles. 

I have spent a lot of time trying to port web code/libraries to native, and this is a massive headache, mainly because all HTML elements let you render text without any limitations.

For example, every `<span>` I turn into `<Text>` results in totally incorrect styles.

I'd be happy to turn this into an umbrella issue and/or assist with PRs if there is some guidance on the best approach to take.

### Move U+200E character to first fragment

> Issue #49534 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49534)

Summary:
Moving the U+200E character ensures that it gets the same font style as other fragments in the LogBox inspector. This solves an issue where the line height differential is causing issues on some out-of-tree platforms (e.g., Windows).

### Setup Package.swift to consume the binaries

> Issue #49435 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49435)

Summary:
This change adds a Package.swift file that allows to consume the binary from a local path.

As soon as we publish this on Maven, we will update the path to the url.

## Changelog:
[Internal] - Add the Package.swift file to consume the binary

Differential Revision: D69660943

## Test Plan

Tested in a sample app.

Just created a Sample App from Xcode, and renamed the ViewController. m --> ViewController.mm

Then I added the package dependency through the `Package Dependencies` tab in Xcode

I modified Target's header search path to point to:
```
${BUILD_DIR}/${CONFIGURATION}-${PLATFORM_NAME}/ReactNativeDependencies.framework/Headers
```

<img width="1428" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-14 at 16 49 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/224bd3a8-736c-4342-b1e3-281d87811cd5" />

After this step, it works flawlessly:
