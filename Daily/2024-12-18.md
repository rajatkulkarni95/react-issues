Closes https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/47740.

### Compress xcframework to let sonatype sign it

> Issue #49753 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49753)

Summary:
Sonatype cannot sign folders. It needs a file to be signed.
To make it happen, we are compressing the xcframeworks and the dSYM with tar, and we are uploading those files instead of the folders

I also observed that the cache keys were not computed correctly, so I'm fixing them.

## Changelog:
[Internal] - use tar.gz instad of folders for dSYM and xcframeworks

Summary:
This diff enables compilation warning flags for the directory in question. Further details are in [this workplace post](https://fb.workplace.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02XaWNiCVk69r1ghfvDVpujB8Hr9Y61uDvNakxiZFa2jwiPHscVdEQwCBHrmWZSyMRl&id=100051201402394).

This is a low-risk diff. There are **no run-time effects** and the diff has already been observed to compile locally. **If the code compiles, it work; test errors are spurious.**

### [0.77] Restore Metro log streaming via CLI flag

> Issue #49356 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49356)

## Summary

> [!Note]
> This is a separate version of https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49353 / D69469039 targeting the `0.77-stable` branch.

This change adds an opt-in to restore JavaScript log streaming via the Metro dev server, [removed from React Native core in 0.77](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/01/21/version-0.77#removal-of-consolelog-streaming-in-metro).

Users can opt into this legacy behaviour by adding the `--client-logs` flag to `npx @react-native-community/cli start`.

- The default experience remains without streamed JS logs.
- The existing "JavaScript logs have moved! ..." notice is printed in all cases, and we do not advertise the new flag for new users.
- Under non-Community CLI dev servers (i.e. Expo), log streaming is restored implicitly.

We will clean up this functionality again when we eventually remove JS log streaming over `HMRClient`, tasked in T214991636.

**Implementation notes**

- Logs are always sent over `HMRClient` (previous status quo), even with log streaming off in the dev server. This is a necessary evil to be able to flag this functionality in a user-accessible place, and to move fast for 0.78.
- Necessarily, emitting `fusebox_console_notice` moves to the dev server itself, on first device (Fusebox) connection.

Changelog:
[General][Added] - Add opt in for legacy Metro log streaming via `--client-logs` flag

## Test Plan

```
cd packages/rn-tester/
yarn start [--client-logs]
```

**Default**

✅ Logs are **not visible** in dev server
✅ Logs are visible in DevTools
✅ RNDT logs warning is shown **once**

**With `--client-logs`**
