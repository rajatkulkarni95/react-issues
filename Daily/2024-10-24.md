## Summary:

<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->

On the new architecture the `RCTParagraphTextView` is used to draw text on iOS but React doesn't know about it. The hit test stops propagation on the first encountered  UIView of this type. The suggested solution is to add a dummy hit test for `RCTParagraphTextView` that returns always `null`, allowing further search of the touch target.

### cipolleschi/0 77 properly handle null values tm interop

> Issue #49298 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49298)

## Summary:
This PR targets `0.78-stable` and it mimics this other PR on `main` https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49250

The original PR has not landed in `main` yet, but we need it if we want to prepare a golden release candidate.

The problem we are seeing is that some legacy module were passing null values from JS to Native and the null value was used in native to make business logic decisions.

In the New Architecture, null values passed down from JS to Native are stripped out and native does not receive them.
This break some Legacy Libraries that are not migrated to the New Architecture yet.

This change fixes this problem and properly forward null values to modules working throught the interop layer.

## Changelog:
[iOS][Fixed] - Properly handle null value in TurboModule Interop layer.

## Test Plan:
Tested in a reproducer provided by the community.
All internal tests on the mentioned PR on main are green.
