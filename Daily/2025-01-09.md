### RN: Set `react.runtime=automatic` in Flow Config

> Issue #50001 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50001)

Summary:
Updates `react-native/.flowconfig` with the following option:

```plaintext
react.runtime=automatic
```

This adjusts Flow to model the current behavior of React and JSX, relaxing the requirement that JSX elements have `React` within scope.

Changelog:
[General][Changed] - Changed Flow for the React Native monorepo, so that `React` no longer has to be in scope when using JSX.

### React Native + React Native Navigation for Web without Expo

> Issue #49884 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49884)

### Description

Greetings, everyone.

I can't use the Expo framework due to project requirements.

Is it possible to use React Navigation in a vanilla React Native project that has React Native for Web installed?

The documentation states that this is possible,
but it doesn't explain how exactly:

<https://reactnavigation.org/docs/web-support/>

Can you provide a minimal example?

An example of React Native Navigation that works without Expo on the Web (Webpack, ESBuild or something else..)

Thanks.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Install vanilla React Native.
2. Install React Native for Web and React Native Navigation libraries.
3. Run this in the browser.

I tried to bundle using ESBuild:

...
alias: {
'react-native': 'react-native-web',
},
...

and removed Flow types using this library:
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-plugin-flow>

### React Native Version

0.78.0

### Affected Platforms

Runtime - Web

| package | version |
| --- | --- |
| esbuild. | 0.25.0. |

### metro-config: Don't always assert import/require with unstable_enablePackageExports

> Issue #49780 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49780)

Summary:
Now that we're using a minimum Metro version of 0.81.3, Metro will dynamically assert `import` or `require` based on the style of the import at source.

Asserting both is likely to cause issues with `babel/runtime` and potentially other packages - see <https://github.com/facebook/metro/pull/1447>.
