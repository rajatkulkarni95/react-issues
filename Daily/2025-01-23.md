### Add `updateShadowTree` to UIManager

Summary:

[General][Added] - Add `updateShadowTree` to UIManager

We have an internal method `updateShadowTree` that does similar thing as `ReanimatedModuleProxy::cloneShadowTreeWithNewProps` in reanimated, with which we can efficiently commit props for multiple shadowNodes onto ShadowTree. it guarantees every ShadowNode that needs to be updated in this commit is only cloned once.

### Serialize and send Profile trace events after emitting the buffer

> Issue #49794 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49794)

Summary:
# Changelog: [Internal]

Before, we would store all User Timings and Timeline Events in the PerformanceTracer's buffer, and then add Profile event to it as well.

On larget apps, the amount of events buffered could reach ~100k, which inevitably would cause OOM.

With this approach, we will flush out buffered events from PerformanceTracer first, then do JavaScript Profile serialization, then send it over CDP straight away.

### Turbomodule method with Int32 param not bridged correctly

> Issue #49688 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49688)

### Description

**Passing an Int32 as a param to a Turbomodule will result in a wrong encoded NSInteger.**

Given a basic spec for a simple TurboModule that takes an Int32 as parameter (from CodegenTypes):
```
import type { TurboModule } from 'react-native';
import { TurboModuleRegistry } from 'react-native';
import { Int32 } from 'react-native/Libraries/Types/CodegenTypes';

export interface Spec extends TurboModule {
  setMyInt32(value: Int32): void;
}

export default TurboModuleRegistry ? TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing<Spec>('TestModule') : undefined;
```

Codegen generates the following ObjC signature for that method:
```
- (void)setMyInt32:(NSInteger)value 
```

However in the ObjCTurboModule::setInvocationArg only a BOOL, double or NSNumber seems to be supported. The Int32 value is interpreted as a double and the output of an NSLog  
```
- (void)setMyInt32:(NSInteger)value { 
    NSLog(@"My Int32 (ObjC): %ld", value);
}
```
is
My Int32 (ObjC): 4617315517961601024

Where invoking the turboModule on the Javascript side:
```
const myValue = 5;
console.log(`My Int32 (JS): ${myValue}`);
NativeTestModule.setMyInt32(myValue);
```
outputs:
My Int32 (JS): 5

It looks like ObjCInteropTurboModule is taking into account a wider set of param types.

### Steps to reproduce

Using the snippets above a basic setup of a Turbomodule can be made
Calling **NativeTestModule.setMyInt32(5);**
Will result in a bridged output of
**My Int32 (ObjC): 4617315517961601024**
