### Add Nightly support for prebuilds

> Issue #49991 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49991)

Summary:
This change adds nightly support for prebuilds.

t works the same way hermes works: if the react native version contains nightly, we try to use that version to download the right tarball.

To work, it needs to use the `RCT_USE_RN_DEP` env variable.

## Changelog
[Internal] - Add Nightly support to consume ReactNativeDependencies

### Fix elevation with border-radius set (#48982)

> Issue #49877 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49877)

## Summary:

This pull request re-applies a previous commit included in React Native versions 0.77 and 0.79, but missing in version 0.78. The commit (55d5c4497621a8dfd6545899754451fcf68dce70) addresses an issue related to elevation radius, which was causing inconsistencies in the rendering behavior. The fix was unable to be cherry-picked directly to 0.78 due to merge conflicts, as discussed by @cortinico in the issue thread [#806](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/issues/806#issuecomment-2704355102).

## Changelog:

[Android] [Fixed] - Elevation prop on android has incorrect border-radius

## Test Plan:

- I ran tests using the provided rn-tester app and confirmed that the elevation rendering behavior is now consistent across versions.
- The changes were tested on Android, ensuring the elevation radius issue was resolved.
- I verified that no other functionality was broken after reapplying this commit.
- This fix was tested in the context of the fix-elevation-radius branch and works as expected.

### codegen fails for `StringEnumTypeAnnotation`

> Issue #49566 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49566)

### Description

Hi! Not sure why it has surfaced now and not before, but seems like https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/48343/files broke codegen for these kinds of usages: https://github.com/callstack/react-native-pager-view/blob/2afcbf9bcfbfad0bee90c66c344f5cfebcf9836a/src/PagerViewNativeComponent.ts#L23

Apologies, I don't have an isolated repro now, as I'm finishing other stuff first


stacktrace below

### Steps to reproduce

I don't have an isolated repro now but I think creating a clean project and adding react-native-pager-view and then building for Android will reproduce the issue

### Border radius not working in TextInput in v0.75.5

> Issue #49373 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/49373)

### Description

borderTopLeftRadius, borderTopRightRadius, borderBottomLeftRadius and borderBottomRightRadius is behaving in a very abrupt manner i React native version 0.75.5
Since it's a version specific bug and the expo snack is running on latest version, and also I can't find any expo sdk related to RNv0.75.5, you can't see any kind of bug in the snack due to react native version mismatch. You can see the bug in the provided screenshot

--> App.js code
```js
import {View, TextInput, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        backgroundColor: 'black',
        flex: 1,
        padding: 50,
      }}>
      <View
        style={{
          flexDirection: 'column',
          width: '100%',
          marginVertical: 6,
          flex: 0.6,
          gap: 30
        }}>
        <TextInput
          style={{
            flex: 1,
            height: '100%',
            backgroundColor: '#ffff',
            borderTopLeftRadius: 40,
            color: '#000',
          }}
          placeholder="Top left radius"
        />
        <TextInput
          style={{
            flex: 1,
            height: '100%',
            backgroundColor: '#ffff',
            borderTopRightRadius: 40,
            color: '#000',
          }}
          placeholder="Top Right radius"
        />
        <TextInput
          style={{
            flex: 1,
            height: '100%',
            backgroundColor: '#ffff',
            borderBottomLeftRadius: 40,
            color: '#000',
          }}
          placeholder="Bottom left radius"
        />
        <TextInput
          style={{
            flex: 1,
            height: '100%',
            backgroundColor: '#ffff',
            borderBottomRightRadius: 40,
            color: '#000',
          }}
          placeholder="Bottom right radius"
        />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}
