### Make missing parent view state in updateLayout a soft error

> Issue #49951 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49951)

Summary:
We previously fixed Differentiator generating an incorrect parentTag (<https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/48055>), but this can lead to crashes in Android UI due to reordering that happens in the Android mounting layer. While we have an experiment to disable this reordering (<https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/46702>) this currently has a negative performance impact which needs to be addressed.

As a mitigation, we can make the lookup of parentTag's ViewManager state nullable. We only require this to support `needsCustomLayoutForChildren`, which is not commonly used, and seems acceptable to drop in this scenario.

Changelog: [Android][Changed] Do not crash when parent view state can't be found
