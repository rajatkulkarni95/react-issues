## Description

 As so far , only next.js and react original js support react server componet.

In next.js  developer is to being requested to use “use client” to idenfy the react client component , and all of the other js are default to react server component.

In the community find the another way to identity component is to change its file suffix
'.server.js' means this is a server component
'.client.js' means its a client component 

So I want to know **what is the react official identifier for server component and client component in future?**
