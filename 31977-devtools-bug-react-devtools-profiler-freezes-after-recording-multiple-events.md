## Description

### Website or app

### Repro steps

I'm experiencing an issue with React DevTools while debugging a project locally. Here are the steps to reproduce the issue:

1. Open React DevTools and navigate to the Profiler tab.
2. Start a recording by clicking on "Start Profiling," then stop it by clicking on "Stop Profiling."
3. View the recording results without any issues.
4. Attempt to start a new recording by clicking on "Start Profiling" again.
5. After a few moments, the Profiler becomes extremely slow or completely unresponsive.
6. At this point, I am unable to make additional recordings or refresh the Profiler data.

I hope these details help in identifying and resolving the issue. Let me know if you need further information or clarification.
