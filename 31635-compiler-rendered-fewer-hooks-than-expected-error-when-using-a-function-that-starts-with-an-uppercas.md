### Repro steps

The application crashes when clicking the button. The the local state of `Repro` changes so it re-rendereds and that's when the error is triggered.

- If the `ChildComponent` function is renamed to `childComponent`, the issue disappears.
- If the `ChildComponent` function is refactored to an arrow function with implicit return, the issue disappears: `const ChildComponent = () => <>â†‘ click the button</>`
- When rendering the child component as usual (`<ChildComponent />` the error is not triggered). I know that should be the normal thing to do, but I had this problem because a third party library was expecting children components being of a specific types. I started doing regular components and when I noticed that limitation I changed them to function calls and that's when I found this problem in the react compiler.

This issue doesn't happen when the application is built without the `babel-plugin-react-compiler` plugin.
