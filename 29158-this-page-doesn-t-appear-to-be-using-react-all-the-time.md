## Description

I am running a project in react and I installed the latest React Dev Tools plugin 5.2.0 (5/8/2024). For some reason, when I test on my webpage built using react, I got the message "This page doesn’t appear to be using React." all the time!

I tested on Chrome and Brave (both on their last versions).

Thanks
