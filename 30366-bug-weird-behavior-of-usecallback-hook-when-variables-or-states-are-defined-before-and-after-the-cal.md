## Description

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.

  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.

When using ES5 with React Hooks, defining one dependency above and another below `useCallback()` results in either partial updates or correct code execution (as if both dependencies are defined above). This inconsistent behavior disrupts the expected functionality of `useCallback()`, making it difficult to manage state updates reliably and leading to unpredictable results.

**The main question is why React exhibits this behavior when dependencies are defined in such a manner and what the implications of doing this might be for the application.**
