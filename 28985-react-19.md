# [React 19]

## Description

1. Congested File Issue: Whenever we download the react package using yarn or node then there are a lot of file that get downloaded everytime and thereby making difficult for beginners to understand the code written inside the "src" file.
If you can remove those packages, it will be helpful, also if you people provide an option that while the user want those files or not then it will be well and better.


2. Optimization Issue while re-rendering the root web-page.

Everytime we reload the webpage the React.strictmode() runs twice and thereby reducing performance of web applications.

If you can remove the dev dependency, that is already been installed while downloading the web-pack.
