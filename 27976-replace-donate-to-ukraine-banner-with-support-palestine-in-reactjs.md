## Description

The current banner on the ReactJS website prompts users to "Donate to Ukraine." The request is to update this banner to reflect a call for support to Palestine instead. This change involves altering the text and possibly the visual elements associated with the banner.

Steps to Reproduce:

Navigate to the area displaying the "Donate to Ukraine" banner.
Identify the code responsible for rendering this banner in the ReactJS codebase.
Modify the text and any related assets to reflect the message "Support Palestine."
Ensure the changes are correctly implemented and display as intended in the application.
Expected Behavior:
After implementing the changes, the banner should now encourage users to support Palestine instead of Ukraine.
