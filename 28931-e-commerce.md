The key elements are an introduction, the background of the idea, market opportunity, revenue metrics, funding, and exit strategy.
4) Business model disruption has four stages. The first one implies that the disruption creates new products, usually of low quality and price, but disruptors also look for new financial resources for business. During the second stage, the products, that have been created during the first one, are improved to become valuable and attract customers from the incumbents’ market. The business process of selling a new product becomes important during the third stage. The ending, or the fourth stage, comes when incumbents lose a market share or move to another market. Thus, finding new customers is another option for incumbents to survive.

Finally, the access point allows the Web page data to be downloaded directly and wirelessly to my tablet.

Social media implementation is the fifth phase, during which the project has to develop its presence on the most popular social networks.

The IoT is applicable to any devices nowadays, from cars or houses to clothes, watches, and so on. The first security issue of the IoT is its interoperability. Others are security and privacy since the devices are personalized but vulnerable to patches.

The last two processes are finding the options to take and identifying possible consequences. The best principle is to imagine oneself in someone else’s place since this helps evaluate the fairness of a decision. Applying the collective utilitarian principle is another option, and the action in this situation is taken to benefit more people.
19) The purpose of intellectual property law is to provide a balance between the public interest of the distribution of intellectual property and the private interest of creators to save a monopoly for tangible and intangible products, generated in the human mind. Types of intellectual property protection are trademark law, patent, and copyright.
20) Online retailers face difficulties since the pioneers of this industry dealt with a small number of users and the shipping price for large-sized items was high. They also charged low prices for their products and services, but they did not work on a business strategy. After 2015, when customers started to prefer online shopping to offline and fees decreased, the earnings started to grow constantly and surpass the profits of offline market competitors. Online retailers understood that consumers valued convenience more than rice.
21) Online career services are so well suited to the Web as they have reduced total hiring time and provided efficient services for an employer and a candidate. Thus, online career services can pre-screen a person before an interview, which will allow them to avoid a meeting with unqualified candidates since such situations often arise in internal referral programs.
22) The three basic revenue models for digital content delivery are subscription, a la carte subscription, and advertising-supported. In the subscription model, a customer receives all content from the resource they have chosen. A la carte subscription is a form of subscription, but the user pays for the content they use. Advertising-supported revenue model provides content for free, but the company receives revenue from advertising. Such a model means that the quality of content is low, but it is still entertaining.
23) Pure digital news sites do not spend money for printing their content on paper, and they can easily convert to more efficient business processes. Such sites offer user-generated content and employ innovation to generate news quickly. Traditional print newspapers have quality journalism, they are reliable, and they spread accurate information.
24) Social networks are used as a marketing tool, advertisement, and branding resource. Communication between a customer and companies has become direct since every user can post feedback about the product and a firm can see it and respond. Businesses care about their online reputation as they check comments from consumers all the time. Therefore, they are afraid of public pressure in case of a failure to meet customers’ needs or to improve products and services.
25) Online auctions have four major types. The English auction implies that a seller sells a single item, the process has a time limit, and multiple buyers participate in bidding. The Dutch auction helps sell numerous identical items. During the Name Your Own Price auction, buyers tell the price and sellers bid. Usually, such auctions sell vacation packages, airline tickets, or hotel reservations. Finally, penny auction is an event, where participants pay for bidding on the site beforehand, and the fee varies from 50 cents to a dollar. The main difference between this and other auction types that even if a participant does not purchase anything, they still pay for participation and bidding.
