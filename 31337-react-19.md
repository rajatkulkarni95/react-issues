## Description

## Summary

The react compiler may have a simpler solution while maintaining good old ecological compatibility

1. react does not require radical optimization

2. Rerendering of react is not really the problem

3. memo isn't the biggest headache in react

The problem with react is that large forms and large lists are slow, which is not the same as rerendering



Perhaps, the react team can try to make the compiler to correctly wrap if for only the part of ui changes, this is the most noteworthy place, to avoid the large list and modify a single form field to trigger the global form collective update, use starts with hook, as the root, will not be wrapped by if. Only consider whether data departing from use requires a package



If you can handle large forms and large amounts of data updating at the same time, as long as the card is not stuck, whether or not the memo and whether or not the re-render becomes less important
