### Repro steps

Hello,

I have installed and setup `eslint-plugin-react-compiler`.

Given the following code:
```tsx
import api from `@shared/api`
export default function JobsPage() {
  const { data, status, refetch } = api.get("/hello").useQuery()
                                 // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ - `Hooks must be the same function on every render, but this value may change over time to a different function`
}
```
 `eslint-plugin-react-compiler` will report the error `Hooks must be the same function on every render` 
The error is correct, but I still don't see anything really wrong with that code. 

Can you please take a look and see if this case here is a false positive? 
Should this code be treated as OK?
If not, do you have a suggestion of what could be done as an alternative?


#### What version of `eslint-plugin-react-compiler` are you using?

`19.0.0-beta-0dec889-20241115`

### [React 19] useState's setter function becomes arity 2

> Issue #31578 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31578)

## Summary

The setter from useState becomes arity 2 in React's 19.0.0-rc.1 release.

Haven't found a changelog entry (https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19 or https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide), neither looking at the commits, so I'm not sure if it's intentional or I might miss something here.

## Demo

React's 18 setStates is arity 1 https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/setstate-arity-1-react-18-pfdr3h
React's 19.0.0-rc.1 setState becomes arity 2 https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/setstate-arity-2-issue-react-19-x3l3kd
