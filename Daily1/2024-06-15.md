### Bug: "Should not already be working" Error Provides No Information (Not Even the Name Indicates What's Wrong)

> Issue #29908 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29908)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version:
18.3.1

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Write a test in React Testing Library
2. Run it
3. Get an error "Should not already be working" when testing library clicks on something (even a button with no `onClick`)
4. Have no clue what's going on or how to resolve

## Link to code example:

Unfortunately the code involves like ten component files, a test file, some test helper files, etc. which I can't include here.  Really, my code example isn't important to the ticket, but for reference the key bit is:

    import userEvent, { UserEvent } from '@testing-library/user-event';
    // ... test stuff ...
    const user = userEvent.setup()
    const applyButton = getByText('Apply');
    // Log applyButton, confirm we did find an element
    user.click(applyButton)

Which results in:

>  ‚ùØ Proxy.default src/myFile.test.tsx:7:41

because of some unknown code being tested (if I knew what code I'd happily paste it here ... but then I wouldn't need to file this ticket).

In general , when React tells you something is wrong, it always tell you **_what_** is wrong, to the best of its ability.  With many React errors you not only get a helpful error message, but there's even a link to a webpage with further info :)

With this error, the message tells you nothing useful, and even Googling tells you almost nothing (it has something to do with blocking actions inside `useEffect`?) 

React should (more politely) say:

>Hey dummy, you did X: that's wrong.  Let me make sure you understand why X is wrong, and also how you can fix it"

A "react error documentation link" would certainly be nice, but even just an improved error message would be helpful.

## The current behavior

> Error: Should not already be working.

With an unhelpful stacktrace that doesn't mention any of the files actually involved:

 ‚ùØ performConcurrentWorkOnRoot node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:25742:11
 ‚ùØ flushActQueue node_modules/react/cjs/react.development.js:2667:24
 ‚ùØ act node_modules/react/cjs/react.development.js:2582:11
 ‚ùØ node_modules/@testing-library/react/dist/act-compat.js:47:25
 ‚ùØ renderRoot node_modules/@testing-library/react/dist/pure.js:180:26
 ‚ùØ render node_modules/@testing-library/react/dist/pure.js:271:10
 ‚ùØ renderHook node_modules/@testing-library/react/dist/pure.js:318:7

## The expected behavior

This is an example; if I actually understood what this error meant, I'd write a PR with the new message, instead of this ticket.

> Error: You attempted to call a blocking action (eg. window.alert) inside a useEffect callback.  You must take this action out of the normal flow, for instance by putting it inside a setTimeout callback.

(And then, ideally, you'd get a stack trace that takes you to the `useEffect` that caused this problem.)

### [Compiler]: Type inference information does not propagate past phi nodes

> Issue #29907 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29907)

### What kind of issue is this?

- [ ] React Compiler core (the JS output is incorrect, or your app works incorrectly after optimization)
- [ ] babel-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the Babel plugin)
- [ ] eslint-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the eslint plugin)
- [ ] react-compiler-healthcheck (build issue installing or using the healthcheck script)

### Link to repro

https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhAMygOzgFwJYSYAEAwhALYAOhCmOAFMJQIwC+AlEcADrFEA2CHEQDa-CAEMAJnkwBzADREwQgDKSZ8gLpEAvESgqAyjgk4E9NBP4r2vIgKGiIOABYIYSlTgDybjzr6hggmZhZWNgh2mPaOwpDkCABqEjAA3LF4aET0LJw8fA4Jyal6ymoasnIZfKxECJFcsUUUJTBl3n7u6bGsvLGCwjAIYB2tKT18wziwxMNgNX2YIKxAA

### Repro steps

The following output is obtained after the InferTypes pass.

```javascript
...
bb1 (block):
  predecessor blocks: bb2 bb3
  someVar$51:TFunction<BuiltInSetState>: phi(bb2: someVar$46, bb3: someVar$49)
  [19] <unknown> $52 = LoadLocal <unknown> someVar$51
  [20] <unknown> $54 = StoreLocal Let <unknown> res$53 = <unknown> $52
  [21] <unknown> $55 = LoadLocal <unknown> res$53
  [22] Return <unknown> $55
```

I would expect the type (`TFunction<BuiltInSetState>`) of `someVar$51` phi node to propagate at instruction 19 but it does not happen.

I was able to figure out why it happens. During SSA generation the phi node's identifier has a `typeId` which is different than the identifier at instruction 19.

I tried to fix this by adding the following patch (to be run right after enterSSA pass) which just makes sure in such cases we always use the same `typeId`: 

```javascript
  // Ensure PHI node types are the same as their uses
  let ssaTypeRemap: Map<IdentifierId, Type> = new Map()
  for (const [_, block] of func.body.blocks) {
    block.phis.forEach(p => {
      ssaTypeRemap.set(p.id.id, p.type);
    })
  }
  for (const [_, block] of func.body.blocks) {
    for (const instr of block.instructions) {
      mapInstructionOperands(instr, (place) => {
        if (ssaTypeRemap.has(place.identifier.id)) {
          place.identifier.type = ssaTypeRemap.get(place.identifier.id)!;
        }
        return place;
      });
    }
    mapTerminalOperands(block.terminal, (place) => {
      if (ssaTypeRemap.has(place.identifier.id)) {
        place.identifier.type = ssaTypeRemap.get(place.identifier.id)!;
      }
      return place;
    });
  }
```
With this patch however 6 testcases fail:

```bash
Failures:

FAIL: phi-type-inference-property-store
 >> Unexpected error during test: 
Expected fixture `phi-type-inference-property-store` to succeed but it failed with error:

Invariant: Invalid mutable range for scope. Scope @3 has range [0:18] but the valid range is [1:22]
FAIL: phi-type-inference-array-push

 >> Unexpected error during test:

FAIL: mutable-lifetime-loops
 >> Unexpected error during test: 
Expected fixture `mutable-lifetime-loops` to succeed but it failed with error:

FAIL: for-in-statement-continue

 >> Unexpected error during test: 
Expected fixture `alias-while` to succeed but it failed with error:

/alias-while.ts: cycle detected
FAIL: meta-isms/repro-cx-assigned-to-temporary
```
1. The mutable range inference pass gets a weird range (I am not sure how starting location can be zero, I guessed that the mutable range must start at atleast instruction idx + 1).

2. inference fails with a cycle detected.

I would appreciate some insights, thank you.

### [React 19] When multiple components call `use` inside a `Suspense`, it crosses the boundary of `Suspense` and stops rendering of other `Suspense` as well

> Issue #29905 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29905)

## Summary

```tsx
import { Suspense, use, useState } from "react";

const f = async (wait) => {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, wait));
  return new Date();
};

const App = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Expected />
      <Unexpected />
    </>
  );
};

const Expected = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <div>üëç</div>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>{open ? "close" : "open"}</button>
      {open && <List wait={[1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000]} />}
    </>
  );
};

const Unexpected = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <div>ü§î</div>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>{open ? "close" : "open"}</button>
      {open && <List wait={[1000, 2000, 3000, 3000, 5000]} />}
    </>
  );
};

const List = ({ wait }) => {
  const [t1] = useState(f(wait[0]));
  const [t2] = useState(f(wait[1]));
  const [t3] = useState(f(wait[2]));
  const [t4] = useState(f(wait[3]));
  const [t5] = useState(f(wait[4]));

  return (
    <>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading No.1 ...</div>}>
        <Item time={t1} />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading No.2 ...</div>}>
        <Item time={t2} />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading No.3 ...</div>}>
        <Item time={t3} />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading No.4 & No.5 ...</div>}>
        <Item time={t4} />
        <Item time={t5} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
};

const Item = ({ time }) => {
  const t = use(time);

  console.log("render item");

  return <div>{t.toISOString()}</div>;
};

export default App;

```
https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/use-and-suspense-hlcjk6

The two components `<Expected>`üëç and `<Unexpected>`ü§î are expected to behave in the same way. That is, No.1 to No.3 should be displayed one second apart, and No.4 and No.5 should be displayed two seconds after No.3 is displayed.

There is a difference in the waiting time for No.4 between `<Expected>` and `<Unexpected>`, being 4 seconds or 3 seconds, but since they are wrapped together in `<Suspense>` with No.5, they should be throttled and displayed after 5 seconds.

However, in `<Unexpected>`, not only that, but No.3, which should belong to a different `<Suspense>` scope, is also displayed after 5 seconds. This seems to break the behavior of `<Suspense>`.

Please note that this is a different issue from the one being discussed in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26380. I am issuing a Promise outside of Suspense and passing it as props.
