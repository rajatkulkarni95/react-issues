### [React 19] useOptimistic - Add option to disable rollback

> Issue #31595 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31595)

## Summary

`useOptimistic` automatically rolls back upon error. Can we make this optional?

Use case: I would like to keep the optimistic data displaying upon error, and display a "Try again" button next to it. (yes, I could do this without useOptimistic, but I suspect this will be a common use case).

Also, the current rollback on error behavior [isn't documented here](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic), so suggest adding before release.

### Bug: README for react-dom package on npmjs.com links to old documentation page

> Issue #31594 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31594)

Not sure if this is a documentation or packaging issue, so filing it here, please move if I filed the issue in the wrong place.

The links in the README for react-dom package on npmjs.com all point to reactjs.org which starts with a big red box stating "These docs are old and won't be updated".

React version: 18.3.1 (Published 7 months ago).

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom and scroll down to the "API" section near the bottom of the page.

Link to code example:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom

## The current behavior

The links in the API section reference reactjs.org, and when clicking on them, leads to a page with a big red box stating "These docs are old and won't be updated".

## The expected behavior

Links go to a page without a big red box stating "These docs are old and won't be updated".
