### Bug: ForwardRef components cant have display names or types

> Issue #30068 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30068)

I am developing a nested component and children pass events to parent components. I need to inject props to what user decides to put as children. Code example:
```
<ParentComponent>
  <ChildComponent>
    <ChildItemComponent><h1>Hello</h1></ChildItemComponent>
    <ChildItemComponent><h2>World</h2></ChildItemComponent>
  </ChildComponent>
</ParentComponent>
```
There are information exchange from ParentComponent to children via ContextProvider but we need some state change in parent component if children is clicked. I have done this using React.Children.map() and i check if the type of child is ChildComponent, then I clone it and inject update event handlers to the children.
The problem arise because ChildItemComponent needs ref to be passed into it and it is enclosed by forwardRef. This means I have no name to compare if the mapped component type is ChildItemComponent:
```
if (React.isValidElement<ChildItemComponentProps>(elm) && elm.type.toString() === ChildItemComponent.toString()) {
        return React.cloneElement<ChildItemComponentProps>(child, { onChange: setActiveTabByClick });
      }
```
As you can see I am using `toString` method to make what I need but I expect it to have displayName, a more efficient way. I could not find a way that I can set displayName for a forwardRef component.

I apologize in advance if there is a way that I could not find via my searches.

React version:18.2.0

## Steps To Reproduce
try to set display name for a ForwardRef component.

## The current behavior
You cannot set displayName for a forwardRef component

## The expected behavior
You should be able to!

React version:18 
this bug only happen on Production mode, it works fine on Development mode 

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Refreshing My Website to view the SSR skeleton content，the link is https://jimeng.jianying.com/ai-tool/home
3. Sometimes it works fined, but Sometimes the page become black  after SSR skeleton content（we can 4x slower cpu to meet this），I found it's because My SSR content inside "div#root" is removed by this code:
![image](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/22492458/e3ee2132-d190-4966-8908-9525b572c849)
4. It seems that the fiber node has Snapshot(1024) flags, which should be "Update"（4）。I don't know the reason, and why sometimes it works fine, somethimes it works wrong
5. the source code error stack is inside react repo: packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCommitWork.js，commitBeforeMutationEffectsOnFiber Function

More info: our project using ssr to show skeleton,  but we don't want "hydrating", our client side render will return "null" to skip react hydrating.

## The current behavior
somethimes the fiber node has flag "Snapshot"（1024）, which causing my ssr content is removed

## The expected behavior
the fiber node's flag  is always "Update"（4）, which won't remove my ssr content
