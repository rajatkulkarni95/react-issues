### Bug: startTransition is causing TypeError when used directly from react

> Issue #31622 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31622)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version: 18.3.1

## Steps To Reproduce

Getting this error message

`TypeError: Cannot read property 'add' of undefined`

1. Run the code example https://snack.expo.dev/@raajnadar/swr-error-in-expo-sdk-52
2. Run android or ios, the web version works without the error
3. Click the "Call the API button" button inside the mobile app
4. Check the logs tab, when switched to axios there is no issue
5. This happens with `swr` because it uses startTransition internally

<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.

Link to code example:

Import like this

```
export const startTransition: (scope: TransitionFunction) => void =
  IS_REACT_LEGACY
    ? cb => {
        cb()
      }
    : React.startTransition
```
And use like this

```
startTransition(() =>
   setState({ data, isMutating: false, error: undefined })
)
```

Code from this repository https://github.com/vercel/swr/blob/1585a3e37d90ad0df8097b099db38f1afb43c95d/src/mutation/state.ts#L5-L10

## The current behavior

Getting this error when `startTransition` used from React directly

`TypeError: Cannot read property 'add' of undefined`

On Expo snack the error says

`Error: "Cannot read property 'add' of undefined" in TypeError: Cannot read property 'add' of undefined <<     at requestUpdateLane (/data/user/0/host.exp.exponent/files/.expo-internal/5cb1b0c52b8fcab94364327c83b808ee:18892:43) <<     at dispatchSetState (/data/user/0/host.exp.exponent/files/.expo-internal/5cb1b0c52b8fcab94364327c83b808ee:16726:33) <<     at anonymous (swr.mutation:12:14616)`

## The expected behavior

There is no TypeError,

When I tried using the `startTransition` from the `useTransition` hook the problem got solved

### [React 19] Is precedene props for <link> works incorrectly?

## Summary

<!--

-->
code sandbox - https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/currying-framework-fd5tfz

```
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
      <Low />
      <Medium />
      <High />
    </div>
  );
}

function High() {
  return <link rel="stylesheet" precedence="high" href="/high.css" />;
}

function Medium() {
  return <link rel="stylesheet" precedence="medium" href="/medium.css" />;
}

function Low() {
  return <link rel="stylesheet" precedence="low" href="/low.css" />;
}

```

according to [react conf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJOGzVygGcY)  high precedence link tag should be come before medium precedence in head tag,  but actually it renders as it declared in JSX

[the document says](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/link#controlling-stylesheet-precedence) 
> Stylesheets can conflict with each other, and when they do, the browser goes with the one that comes later in the document. React lets you control the order of stylesheets with the precedence prop. In this example, two components render stylesheets, and the one with the higher precedence goes later in the document even though the component that renders it comes earlier.

`higher precedence goes later` <- Is this meaning high precedence should be located after the lower precedence ?? 

Also, the documentation seems not so useful to understand how precedence works,

### Controlling stylesheet precedence example 
```tsx
import ShowRenderedHTML from './ShowRenderedHTML.js';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <ShowRenderedHTML>
      <FirstComponent />
      <SecondComponent />
      ...
    </ShowRenderedHTML>
  );
}

function FirstComponent() {
  return <link rel="stylesheet" href="first.css" precedence="high" />;
}

function SecondComponent() {
  return <link rel="stylesheet" href="second.css" precedence="low" />;
}
```


### rendered html
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="first.css" data-precedence="high" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="second.css" data-precedence="low" />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

This example code's  `<FirstComponent/>` comes before `<SecondComponent/>` and rendered html  shows same it declared in JSX,  which is pretty obvious and has nothing to do with precedence, giving confusion.
