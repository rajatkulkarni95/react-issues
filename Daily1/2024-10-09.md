### Bug: exhaustive-deps not working with eslint 9.12.0

> Issue #31162 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31162)

Here is a simplified version of my `eslint.config.mjs`: 
(There are a lot more rules, custom plugins, ignores, files specifications, etc. but for the sake of this bug, I think this will do)

```js
import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';
import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks';
import { fixupPluginRules } from '@eslint/compat';

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    'react-hooks': fixupPluginRules(reactHooks),
  },
  rules: {
    'react-hooks/rules-of-hooks': 'error',
    'react-hooks/exhaustive-deps': 'error',
});
```

Here are the versions that I am running:

```
yarn list eslint eslint-plugin-react-hooks typescript-eslint

yarn list v1.22.19
warning Filtering by arguments is deprecated. Please use the pattern option instead.
├─ eslint-plugin-react-hooks@4.6.2
├─ eslint@9.12.0
└─ typescript-eslint@8.8.1
Done in 0.42s.
```

If I attempt to run `yarn eslint` without `fixupPluginRules` I get the following error:

```
Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 9.12.0

TypeError: context.getSource is not a function
Occurred while linting FILE (this is a placeholder)
Rule: "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps"
```

When I run `yarn lint` with `fixupPluginRules` it works fine.

If found the solution to this here: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/troubleshooting/v9-rule-api-changes
That eslint documentation explicitly states that if fixupPluginRules is required, I should open an issue on the plugin

### Bug: [eslint-plugin-react-hooks] Compatibility issue with ESLint 9.x.x

> Issue #31158 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31158)

It appears that `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` is not compatible with ESLint version 9.x.x. 
When attempting to use ESLint 9.x.x with `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, I encounter dependency resolution issues, specifically that the plugin does not support ESLint 9.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install ESLint 9.x.x along with `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`.
2. Run ESLint or install dependencies.
3. Encounter peer dependency conflict or related errors.

Expected behavior:
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` should support ESLint 9.x.x without errors.

Actual behavior:
- Peer dependency conflicts or errors occur during installation or usage of ESLint 9 with this plugin.

React version:     "react": "18.3.1",

Link to code example:

## The current behavior
npm install with --legacy-peer-dependencies

these are my packages
"eslint": "^9.8.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "7.35.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "4.6.0",

## The expected behavior

npm i without the legacy peer flag
