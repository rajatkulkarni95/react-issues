### [React 19] `form.requestSubmit()` resets input value/defaultValue after transition

> Issue #30532 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30532)

## Summary

When form is submitted through `form.requestSubmit()` the input displays the older value instead of the current state.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37bcbaaf-b680-43f0-95db-a57d276753a1

I tested using `value` and `defaultValue` props, and both leads to the same issue. When the form is submitted through `<button type="submit">` it works fine, and `form.submit()` also has no problem, the issue is only using `form.requestSubmit()`.
I suspect that this is an issue in `react-dom` reconciler. The state is correct in the log, but the actual `<input>` value is not.
In the repro there is an `useOptimistic` but this happens without it too.

Version:
```
"react": "^19.0.0-rc-941e1b4a-20240729",
"react-dom": "^19.0.0-rc-941e1b4a-20240729"
```

> To make sure this wasn't reported, I tried searching for `transition state reset`, `useActionState` and `requestSubmit`, didn't find anything related.

Hi @looweb. Did you ever solve this issue?

### Bug: Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "useState", dispatcher is null

> Issue #30520 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30520)


### Problem
Calling `useState` within the root component of a self-contained HTML file produces the following errors:
1. `Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.`
2. `Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "useState", dispatcher is null`

Browsers tried: Firefox Developer Edition, Chromium, Firefox

Operating system: Arch Linux
 
#### Minimal Reproducible Example
<details>
<summary>HTML "file" containing minimal reproducible example</summary>


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US">
  <head>

    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.3.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.3.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js"></script>

    <script type="text/babel" defer>

      function MyComponent() {
        const [num, setNum] = React.useState(0)

        return (
          <div>
            hello
          </div>
        )
      }

      const reactAppEntryPointElement = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('react-app-entrypoint'));
      reactAppEntryPointElement.render(MyComponent());
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <div id="react-app-entrypoint"></div>

  </body>
</html>
```
</details>

### Interesting note
Calling `useState` in a nested component produces zero errors

          </div>
        )
      }

      function MyNestedComponent() {
        const [num, setNum] = React.useState(0)

        return <div>Nested</div>
      }

      const reactAppEntryPointElement = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('react-app-entrypoint'));
      reactAppEntryPointElement.render(MyComponent());
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <div id="react-app-entrypoint"></div>

  </body>
</html>

```
