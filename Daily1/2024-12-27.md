### [React 19] new compiler handle the memoization of a function used in useEffect

> Issue #31925 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31925)

previously:

const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleAction = useCallback(() => {
    console.log(count);
  }, [count]);

  useEffect(() => {
    handleAction();
  }, [handleAction]);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>;
};

in react 19 with the new compiler. can i write it simpler like: 

const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleAction = () => {
    console.log(count);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    handleAction();
  }, [handleAction]);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>;
};

and the new compiler handle the memoization of handleAction function ?

### [React 19] is the new compiler remove this unnecessary usgae of the useCallback

> Issue #31924 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31924)

Hello,
using React 19 with the implementation of the new compiler (babel-plugin-react-compiler), no need to use useCallback and memo... explicitly because the new compiler do this job (as react compiler documentation).
my question is if explicitly i use useCallback with a function in my functional component not need the usage of useCallback (significant performance gains). is the new compiler remove this unnecessary usage of the useCallback?

thanks...

### Bug: [React v19] 

> Issue #31923 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31923)

npx create-react-app my-project

If you type in this order, React doesn't install all files and folders, this problem started for me with v19.
Is this a bug on my end or is it on React's end? I couldn't find it.
