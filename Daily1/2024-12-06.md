### Bug: React overwrites functions on customElements

> Issue #31689 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31689)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version: 19.0.0

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Define a custom element as shown:
```js
class CEWithAttrPropertyClash extends HTMLElement {
    test(value) {
        this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('test', {detail: value}))
    }
    connectedCallback() {
        this.test(true);
    }
}

customElements.define('ce-with-attr-property-clash', CEWithAttrPropertyClash);
```
2. Render
```js
render(<ce-with-attr-property-clash test />);
```

<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.
-->

Link to code example: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/green-resonance-kpwcqg?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js%3A10%2C1

<!--
  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a
  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the
  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is
  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal
  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
-->

## The current behavior

```this.test is not a function```


## The expected behavior

React sets attribute as an attribute and does not override function definition

The culprit appears to be this line: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c56c6234328a29930487295afe61597db48f058c/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/DOMPropertyOperations.js#L220

Which does not check to see if the property is a settable property.

### Bug: [eslint-plugin-react-hooks] incorrectly reports an error when hook is called outside of a loop.

> Issue #31687 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31687)

The following code triggers an ESLint error with the rule `eslintreact-hooks/rules-of-hooks` stating:  
> "React Hook 'useState' may be executed more than once. Possibly because it is called in a loop. React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render."

However, the hook `useState` is not inside the loop, and there is no reason for the error to be thrown.

### React version:
React 19.0.0 (latest stable)
eslint-plugin-react-hooks 5.1.0 (latest stable)

## Steps To Reproduce
1. Create a functional component with `useState` hook.
2. Add a `for` loop inside the component (but outside the hook).
3. Run the ESLint with the `eslint-react-hooks` plugin enabled.

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }

  return <div></div>;
};
```

### Link to code example:
https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/8dlj6f
Run `npm run lint`

## The current behavior
ESLint throws an error about `useState` potentially being called multiple times, even though it is not in a loop.

## The expected behavior
No ESLint error should be thrown, as `useState` is not inside the loop, and should follow the rule of hooks correctly.

### Bug: `use` hook throws error in Client Component without SSR when used in child component

> Issue #31686 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31686)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version: 19.0

## Steps To Reproduce

When using the `use` hook with a Promise context in a child component, it throws an error about async/await not being supported in Client Components. However, the same pattern works in the parent component.

<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.
-->

Link to code example:

## Environment
- React version: 19.0.0
- Build tool: Vite
- No SSR implementation

```tsx
import { createContext, use, useState } from "react";
import "./App.css";

const AppCtx = createContext(new Promise<string>((r) => r("React")));

const Child = () => {
  const value = use(AppCtx);
  return <>{use(value)}</>;
};

function App() {
  const [value] = useState(new Promise<string>((r) => r("React")));
  return (
    <AppCtx value={value}>
      Hello
      <Child />
    </AppCtx>
  );
}

export default App;
```

<!--
  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a
  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the
  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is
  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal
  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
-->

## The current behavior

Uncaught Error: async/await is not yet supported in Client Components, only Server Components. This error is often caused by accidentally adding 'use client' to a module that was originally written for the server.

## The expected behavior

Since this is a client-side only application without any SSR, the `use` hook should work consistently in both parent and child components when handling Promise contexts.

### Bug: Since React 19 release my React 18 builds with npm ci are failing

> Issue #31684 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31684)

As soon as React 19 was published on December 5, 2024 approx 4:05PM EST, all my builds for React 18 (18.3.1) in my CICD pipeline are failing with Linting and Types errors raised from when `yarn build` is building my Next JS v 14.0.4 app.

React version: 18.3.1

Before the release, I was able to build my React 18 app without issue, I was building dozens per day. As soon as the React 19 was published it all broke. Any reason for this? I have React 18.3.1 locked in my package.json, my dependency versions are all the same. Did something change with React 18.3.1 version?
