### Bug: circular import between shared/ReactSharedInternals.js and react/src/React.js

> Issue #31126 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31126)

I'm trying to build React packages from source, 
by passing "packages/react/src/React.js" as the entry point to Rollup and transpiling the modules to ESM with flow-parser. 

Several modules in the `react` package import `shared/ReactSharedInternals` (directly or indirectly, eg. https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v18.3.1/packages/react/src/ReactServerContext.js), but `shared/ReactSharedInternals` actually circularly imports "react" itself to access its `react/src/ReactSharedInternals.js` exposed as `React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED` (https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v18.3.1/packages/shared/ReactSharedInternals.js#L13), resulting in this error: 
```
ReferenceError: Cannot access '__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED' before initialization
    at file:///home/blik/facebook_2013_react/0/packages/shared/ReactSharedInternals.js:2:36
```
or as Rollup reports: 
```
Circular dependency: facebook_2013_react/0/packages/react/src/React.js
 -> facebook_2013_react/0/packages/react/src/ReactElementValidator.js
 -> facebook_2013_react/0/packages/shared/checkPropTypes.js
 -> facebook_2013_react/0/packages/shared/ReactComponentStackFrame.js
 -> facebook_2013_react/0/packages/shared/ReactSharedInternals.js
 -> facebook_2013_react/0/packages/react/src/React.js
```

For now, I have redirected imports of `shared/ReactSharedInternals` to `react/src/ReactSharedInternals.js`, but since the "shared" package is used in other packages beside `react`, i should bundle it separately (possibly one by one because they have default exports), in which case i would be duplicating React by it being default-imported for this one property access, leaving no space for even any treeshaking: 
```js
  "facebook_2013_react.js":{"https://github.com/facebook/react/packages/react packages/shared":{"v18.3.1":["packages/react/src/React.js",{
    "syntax":"flow",
    "edit":{
      "__DEV__":"false",
      "packages/react/src/ReactServerContext.js":{"shared/ReactSharedInternals":"./ReactSharedInternals.js"},
      "packages/react":{"from 'shared/":"from '../../shared/"},
      "packages/shared":{"shared/ReactSharedInternals":"../react/src/ReactSharedInternals.js","from 'shared/":"from './","__EXPERIMENTAL__":"false","__PROFILE__":"false"}
    },
    "alias":{"shared/ReactSharedInternals.js":{"react":"./facebook_2013_react/0/packages/react/src/React.js"}},
    "comment":"shared/ReactSharedInternals circularly imports React, which imports it back indirectly. redirected those imports to the original react/src/ReactSharedInternals..."
  }]}},
//"facebook_2013_react_shared.js":{
//  "https://github.com/facebook/react/packages/shared":{"v18.3.1":[
//    "packages/shared/*.js",{"syntax":"flow","alias":{
//      "react":"./facebook_2013_react/0/packages/react/src/React.js"
//    },"comment":"default exports will be lost, react bundled unnecessarily"}
//  ]}
//}
```


- Why isn't `react/src/ReactSharedInternals.js` located in the "shared" package directly to resolve this circular import? 

- How does the official build process access `React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED` in `shared/ReactSharedInternals.js` given the "react" package's circular import graph? 

- How does it share the "shared" modules across packages if the "shared" package can't be bundled as a shared module (due to default exports and a circular import), only be re-included in each package's bundle? 


React version: 18.3.1

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Pass react/src/React.js to Rollup with a plugin to transpile flow 
```js
 import("./rollup.js").then(({rollup})=>rollup(
 {input:"packages/react/src/React.js"
 ,plugins:
[{transform:compose(flow,prunetypes,astring)
 ,resolveId:(source,client)=>source.replace(/^shared/
,shared=>(/react\/src/.test(client)?"../../":"./")+shared)
 }
]}));
```
2. see errors of circular import between `packages/shared/ReactSharedInternals.js -> packages/react/src/React.js`


## The current behavior

Circular import

## The expected behavior

A "shared" module trivial to bundle, and no circular imports from it to peer packages.

### Bug:  Performance Degradation in Concurrent Mode with Suspense and Nested Lazy Components

> Issue #31122 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31122)

When using React's Concurrent Mode with deeply nested `React.lazy` components and `Suspense`, there's noticeable UI lag, especially on slower networks like 3G. It seems like the combination of lazy-loading, deferred updates using `useTransition`, and network delays overwhelms the rendering process, causing sluggish transitions and slower component updates.

### React 19 Beta: Component Suspense Not Fallbacking as Expected

> Issue #31120 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31120)

# React 19 Beta: Component Suspense Not Fallbacking as Expected

I'm experiencing an issue with the Suspense feature in React 19 beta. The fallback component is not rendering when the child component is in a suspended state, leading to a blank screen instead of the intended loading indicator.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a simple component that fetches data asynchronously.
2. Wrap the component with `<Suspense fallback={<Loading />} />`.
3. Trigger the fetch operation that causes the component to suspend.
4. Observe that the fallback is not displayed, and the screen remains blank.

## Expected Behavior:
I expected the `<Loading />` component to display while the data is being fetched.

## Actual Behavior:
The screen remains blank instead of showing the fallback component.

## Code Snippet:

### App
```javascript
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import Loading from "./components/Loading";
import TestComponent from "./components/TestComponent";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <TestComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### TestComponent
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const TestComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  // Simulate data fetching
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/users");
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (!data) {
    throw new Promise(() => {}); // Intentionally suspends the component
  }

  return <div>Data: {data}</div>;
};

export default TestComponent;
```

### Loading Component
```javascript
import React from "react";
import "./Loading.css"; // Import the CSS file for styles

const Loading = () => {
  return (
    <div className="loading-container">
      <h1 className="loading-title">Loading...</h1>
      <div className="spinner"></div>
      <h2 className="loading-subtitle">Please wait JasGiigli</h2>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Loading;
```

## Environment
- **React Version**: 19 beta
- **Node Version**: v22.8.0
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 
- **Browser**:Google Chrome Version 129.0.6668.90 (Official Build) (64-bit)

## Additional Context
I have tested this issue with the latest React 19 beta. It seems that the fallback component is not being activated as expected during the data fetching process. Please let me know if you need any further details or if there are specific scenarios you'd like me to test.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.
