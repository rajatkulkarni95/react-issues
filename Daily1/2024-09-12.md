### Cannot find name 'dialog'

> Issue #30953 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30953)

I am using Typescript together with React 19rc. It appears that the new dialog element has not been added to the @types/react. I did try and add a types.d.ts file with the Intrinsics def but that does nothing.

This is the entire source code but on the affected file itself, https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-React-TypeScript-and-Node-2nd-Edition/blob/chap5/Final/blog/client/src/common/components/modals/Modal.ts
