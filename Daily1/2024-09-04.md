  },
});

root.render();
```

## The current behavior

we get to see this error 

![Screenshot 2024-09-04 at 8 04 08â€¯PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f36be6fc-08cc-4710-81b1-a200e15661c1)

## The expected behavior

if i try to uncomment the `root.render()` call, we see that the actual error is now being shown

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/274ac730-7b93-4948-8a06-a828c4b93cf7

thought the error message needs to be aligned in the context of the validation error from the `createRoot`

https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrateroot

the options according to the doc shall take an Object for the corresponding React root

the actual error message shall be this way

```
 'Warning: You passed an options object as the second argument to `hydrateRoot(...)`, did you forget to pass a React element?',

```

or if someone passes a JSX element to options 

```
 'You passed a JSX element as an options to hydrateRoot. You probably meant to ' +
          'call root.render instead. ' +
          'Example usage:\n\n' +
          '  let root = hydrateRoot(domContainer, <App />, {...options});\n' +
          '  root.render(<App />);',
```

### I am encountering an error when trying to run the command npm run dev. How can I resolve

> Issue #30871 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30871)

I utilized vite to create a frontend template. The package.json resides in the frontend directory and includes development tools, but I'm encountering an error. This project involves Django and React. I am using a Python virtual environment, and the backend is running smoothly. I have also installed React dependencies in the environment, so I am unsure of what the issue could be.
