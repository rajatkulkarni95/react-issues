1. After running, click the Posts button, and you will see multiple outputs in the log executing the memo function

2. It should be noted that if you remove async and await from then, then there will be no phenomenon of executing the memo function multiple times
3. This demo forked from [useTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition )and modified the logic of PostsTab
