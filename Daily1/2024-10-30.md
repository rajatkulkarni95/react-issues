### Bug: `cache` API Not Caching Functions with Object Parameter

> Issue #31390 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31390)

When using the `cache` utility to cache function that takes an object as input, the caching doesn't work.

## React version:
All versions that include the cache API.

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a function using the `cache` utility, with a destructured parameter object as input:
   ```typescript
   import { cache } from "react";

   interface Props {
     params: Promise<{ query?: string; page?: number }>;
   }

   const getPosts = cache(async ({ query, page }: Props["params"]) => {
     // Function logic
   });
   ```

2. Attempt to call `getPosts` multiple times with the same parameters.

3. Observe that caching does not occur, and the function executes on each call instead of retrieving from cache.

In comparison, if the function is structured to accept individual parameters (as shown below), caching works as expected:

```typescript
import { cache } from "react";

const getPosts = cache(async (query?: string, page?: number) => {
  // Function logic
});
```

## The current behavior

When `getPosts` accepts an object as input, caching does not work, and the function executes anew for each call, even with identical parameters.

## The expected behavior

`cache` should correctly cache function calls, regardless of whether the input is provided as individual parameters or a single object. In this case, `getPosts` should only execute once per unique set of parameters, reusing the cached result for subsequent calls with identical parameters.

### Bug: Unexpected axios.get request and wrong AxiosInstance stored in state

> Issue #31389 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31389)

The following content is from automatic translation and may be grammatically incorrect
### React Version:

- React 18.3.1 (Vite)
- React 19.0.0 (Next.js)

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Use `useState` in a component to create an `axiosInstance`.
2. Use `setState` to set the axios instance. Example code:

   ```typescript
   const [instance, setInstance] = useState<AxiosInstance|null>(null);

   setInstance(axios.create({ baseURL: "https://api.example.com" }));
3. This issue can be reproduced in React 18.3.1 (Vite) and React 19.0.0 (Next.js).


## Code Example 
  ```typescript
  import React, { useState } from "react";
  import axios, { AxiosInstance } from "axios";
  
  const ExampleComponent = () => {
    const [instance, setInstance] = useState<AxiosInstance | null>(null);
  
    setInstance(axios.create({
      baseURL: "https://api.example.com"
    }));
  
    return <div>Axios Instance Issue</div>;
  };
  
  export default ExampleComponent;
```
## The Current Behavior
When setting axiosInstance using setState, the instance.get method is automatically triggered, causing an API request. This makes it impossible to store the axiosInstance properly in the state and may lead to the instance being recreated on every render, resulting in unnecessary requests.

You'll then see that your browser automatically sends a GET method request to baseUrl endpoint.
Not only that, but the value of the original instance will automatically refer to a Promise object (which looks like the GET method request)

## The Expected Behavior 
axiosInstance should be properly stored in the state, not a Promise object, and not automatically trigger a get request or cause any unintended side effects.
