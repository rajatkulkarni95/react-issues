    useEffect(() => {
    let preservedId;
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const receivedMessage = JSON.parse(event.data);
      console.log("receivedMessage", receivedMessage);
// getUser func returns id because the state is preservec so I have put the whole function with a dependency and when I receive the message id becomes null again
      preservedId = getUser();
      if (
        !receivedMessage.status &&
        receivedMessage.sender_id === preservedId
      ) {
        setActiveChat((prevMessages) => {
          const filteredMessages = prevMessages.filter(
            (msg) =>
              msg?.message_identifier !== receivedMessage.message_identifier,
          );
          return [...filteredMessages, receivedMessage];
        });
      }
    };
  }, [newUserId]);
-->

## The current behavior
state is not updated inside ws.onmessage , state is preserved inside we.onmessage and the state is working perfectly fine outside ws.onmessage


## The expected behavior
state should get updated

### Bug: Unexpected characters appear in the Chinese encoding during streaming

<!--

React version:
18.3.1

## Steps To Reproduce

When I use remix to stream render a page, sometimes garbled characters appear on the page when my data contains Chinese characters. I saw through debugging that react-dom inserts null characters when parsing, which causes an exception during merging.

https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/76002254b7e3270da199eec1e6f9a0577b988a36/packages/react-server/src/ReactServerStreamConfigNode.js#L75

and when `textEncoder.encodeInto` exec

Due to business issues, I can only provide a short reproducible fragment

```js
var util = require('util')

var textEncoder = new util.TextEncoder()

var target = new Uint8Array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

textEncoder.encodeInto(
  '__remixContext.r("routes/page.$pageName", "getConfig", {"headTitle":"升级有礼","title":"有礼升级至新版立得块优惠券20"',
  target
)
console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(target))
// result: __remixContext.r("routes/page.$pageName", "getConfig", {"headTitle":"升级有礼","title":"有��
```
