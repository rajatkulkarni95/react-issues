### Bug: "Should have a queue. This is likely a bug in React"

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include

**React version:** 18.2.0 

(18.2.0 is required by Expo, but theoretically equivalent to 18.3.1 for this purpose)

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Unknown. No rules of hooks are being broken and the error stack is not helpful for diagnosis.

**Code example:**

I don't know how to reproduce this. Originally I faced #22049, supposedly caused by our "problem hook":

```js
// Supposed problem hook
const linkableRef = useRef(linkable);
useEffect(() => {
  linkableRef.current = linkable; // linkable is an array of objects
  const { current: editor } = editorRef;
  if (editor) editor.commands.updateLinkable();
}, [linkable, editorRef]);
```

and removing the hook causes this instead: `Error: Should have a queue. This is likely a bug in React. Please file an issue.`

## The current behavior
Using our simple hook causes #22049 - and removing our hook causes this issue instead

## The expected behavior
Using React as specified in the docs causes no errors

React version: 16.14.0

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Launch the application using URL: [Bryntum Scheduler - Vertical mode demo (React)](https://www.bryntum.com/products/scheduler/examples/frameworks/react/javascript/vertical/build/).
2. “Vertical mode demo (React)” screen should open.
3. TAB to “Filter Event” button.
4. Run AI4W fast pass and observe the issue.

## The current behavior
Ensures elements with an ARIA role that require child roles contain them (aria-required-children - https://accessibilityinsights.io/info-examples/web/aria-required-children)

Element path: .b-grid-panel-body

 

Snippet: <div class="b-grid-panel-body" role="grid" data-owner-cmp="b-scheduler-1" aria-colcount="2" aria-rowcount="2" aria-owns="b-textfield-1">

## The expected behavior
Element has children which are not allowed: [role=presentation], div[aria-hidden]

  Element uses aria-busy="true" while showing a loader
