### Bug: State updates are being reordered across await in an effect

> Issue #31306 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31306)

## Summary

<!--
  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a
  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the
  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is
  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal
  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.

**Steps To Reproduce :**

```
useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
        setStateA("foo");
        await someAsyncFunctionThatReturnsImmediately();
        setStateA("bar");
    })();
});
```
**The current behavior :**

In React, the second state update ("bar") is rendered first, followed by the first update ("foo"). This reordering occurs only when the awaited function returns immediately. If the awaited promise resolves later, the state updates in the expected order.

In the example, you can observe this by clicking the button and checking the console for the message "BUG RENDERED!!!shockshockshock", or by noticing a brief red flash on the component when it renders incorrectly. The console message appears every time, while the red flash happens occasionally. In our actual app, the incorrect render occurs consistently.

If you modify the example to call await optionalDelay(true), the state updates will be applied in order, and the component will flash green.
