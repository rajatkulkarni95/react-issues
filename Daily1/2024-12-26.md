### [React 19], useCallback not needed now!!!

> Issue #31913 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31913)

my question is, in react 19, the usage of useCallback is deprecated, means react automatically memoize the functions in my functional component? or only memoize the function that hasn't any dependencies. please more clarification about this.
if it is not required, and my app already i used useCallback, and memo... i have any side effect if i continue used it or i need to removed from my app if i want to switch from 18 to 19

thanks.
