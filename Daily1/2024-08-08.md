### [React 19] Inconsistent documentation of useOptimistic second parameter

> Issue #30638 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30638)

## Summary
[Main docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic) show that useOptimistic has a required second parameter updateFn.

[The RC blog post](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19#new-hook-optimistic-updates) does not, though.

The current version, [19.0.0-rc-e948a5ac-20240807](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react/v/19.0.0-rc-e948a5ac-20240807), seems to work without the second parameter ([example](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/use-optimistic-multiple-n6hr29?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js)).

I opened the ticket here and not in the documentation repo, because this is about the upcoming version, and it seems there might not be clarity on what should be the expected behavior. Forgive me if it still was supposed to go on the other repo.

### issue with `useCallback` and `useRef` Cleanup in `useEffect` on Production Build with Next.js

> Issue #30635 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30635)

We are encountering an issue where a `useCallback` function, managed with `useRef`, does not perform cleanup as expected during component unmount in both development and production builds of a Next.js application.

#### Problematic Code

```javascript
import React, { useCallback, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const stopRecordingRef = useRef<() => void>(() => {});

  const [recorder, setRecorder] = React.useState<MediaRecorder | null>(null);
  const [stream, setStream] = React.useState<MediaStream | null>(null);
  const videoRefs = useRef<{ webcam: HTMLVideoElement | null, recordedVideo: HTMLVideoElement | null }>({
    webcam: null,
    recordedVideo: null,
  });

  const stopRecording = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('stopRecording called');
    if (recorder) {
      console.log('Stopping recorder');
      recorder.stop();
    }

    if (stream) {
      console.log('Stopping stream tracks');
      stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
      setStream(null);
    }

    if (videoRefs.current?.webcam) {
      console.log('Clearing webcam srcObject');
      videoRefs.current.webcam.srcObject = null;
    }

    if (videoRefs.current?.recordedVideo) {
      console.log('Clearing recorded video src');
      videoRefs.current.recordedVideo.src = '';
    }
  }, [recorder, stream]);

  useEffect(() => {
    stopRecordingRef.current = stopRecording;
  }, [stopRecording]);

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      console.log('Cleaning up in useEffect');
      if (stopRecordingRef.current) {
        stopRecordingRef.current();
      } else {
        console.log('stopRecordingRef.current is not set');
      }
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {/*JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

#### Expected Behavior

The `stopRecording` function should be executed properly during component unmount via `useEffect`. This function should correctly perform all cleanup operations both in development and production builds.

#### Actual Behavior

- **In Development:** The `stopRecording` function executes correctly, and cleanup operations are performed as expected.
- **In Production Build:** The `stopRecording` function does not execute properly during component unmount, resulting in lingering resources and incorrect references.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Implement the `stopRecording` function using `useCallback`.
2. Use `useRef` to maintain a reference to the `stopRecording` function.
3. Set the reference in `useEffect`.
4. Verify the cleanup process in the production build.

#### Environment

- **Next.js Version:** 12.0.8
- **React Version:** 17.0.2
- **React DOM Version:** 17.0.2

#### Suggestions and Requests

Please investigate this issue and suggest a resolution if available. If a specific solution is not possible, guidance on correctly implementing resource cleanup during component unmounting using `useCallback` and `useRef` in a Next.js environment would be highly appreciated.

### Bug: useId generates duplicate IDs on initial render (ssr)

> Issue #30634 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30634)

I am experiencing an issue with the useId hook in React where it generates duplicate IDs on the initial render, the problem disappear when JS hydrate the page.

React version: ^18.3.0
Remix version: ^2.9.1

## Steps To Reproduce

1. To see the error : https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&showoutline=yes&showimagereport=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.copinesdevoyage.com%2F#l1c2874
2. Or go to https://www.copinesdevoyage.com/ and disable JS
3. The duplicated ids will be found on avatars

## The current behavior
On the initial render, useId hook generates duplicate IDs


## The expected behavior
useId should produce a unique ID, ensuring that no two components have the same ID.
