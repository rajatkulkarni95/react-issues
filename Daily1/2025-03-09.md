### Repro steps

I wrote a very basic client-side hook to read cookie values with manual memoization, and enabling the React Compiler caused it to execute more than it did before.

Before the callback would only function when the value of `document.cookie` changed.

```ts
function useCookies() {
  const cookie = document.cookie;
  return useMemo(() => {
    console.log("useCookies");
    const cookies = cookie.split("; ");
    const cookieMap = new Map<string, string>();

    for (const cookie of cookies) {
      const [key, value] = cookie.split("=");
      cookieMap.set(key, decodeURIComponent(value));
    }

    return cookieMap;
  }, [cookie]);
}
```

After, the Compiler removes the use of `useMemo` altogether.

The version that the Playground produces vs what I'm seeing in my generated sources is different. This is the Playground version:

```ts
import { c as _c } from "react/compiler-runtime";
export function useCookies() {
  const $ = _c(1);
  const cookie = document.cookie;
  let t0;

  console.log("useCookies");
  let cookieMap;
  if ($[0] === Symbol.for("react.memo_cache_sentinel")) {
    const cookies = cookie.split("; ");
    cookieMap = new Map();
    for (const cookie_0 of cookies) {
      const [key, value] = cookie_0.split("=");
      cookieMap.set(key, decodeURIComponent(value));
    }
    $[0] = cookieMap;
  } else {
    cookieMap = $[0];
  }

  t0 = cookieMap;
  return t0;
}
```

This is the version I'm seeing in the produced source, in my Next.js app:

```ts
import { c as _c } from "react/compiler-runtime";
import { useMemo } from "react";
export function useCookies() {
  const $ = _c(2);
  if ($[0] !== "33da8e51bb0e4618f0c4e613cb82efa8d6fe1164e384101fe04ed627eee43a0e") {
    for (let $i = 0; $i < 2; $i += 1) {
      $[$i] = Symbol.for("react.memo_cache_sentinel");
    }
    $[0] = "33da8e51bb0e4618f0c4e613cb82efa8d6fe1164e384101fe04ed627eee43a0e";
  }
  const cookie = document.cookie;
  let t0;
  console.log("cookie");
  let cookieMap;
  if ($[1] === Symbol.for("react.memo_cache_sentinel")) {
    const cookies = cookie.split("; ");
    cookieMap = new Map();
    for (const cookie_0 of cookies) {
      const [key, value] = cookie_0.split("=");
      cookieMap.set(key, decodeURIComponent(value));
    }
    $[1] = cookieMap;
  } else {
    cookieMap = $[1];
  }
  t0 = cookieMap;
  return t0;
}
```

### Bug: Does React enforces the same number and order of hooks across all instances of a component?

> Issue #32558 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32558)

Suppose I have two instances of the same component. One uses a custom hook with two useState calls, and another uses a different custom hook with three useState calls. Intuitively, since they're separate instances, their state should be independent.

I came up with a sample implementation which works fine having different number of hooks for 2 different instances of the same component (MyComponent). This is achieved via conditionally plugging a custom hook to the component body when mounting with the help of a useState init function that guarantees picking a custom hook occurs only one time.

`const [conditionalHook] = useState(() => (count % 2 === 1) ? useCustomB : useCustomA);`

Is there any drawbacks?

**Note:** The following logic can also be used to set custom hook conditionally without a useState init function

`const conditionalHook = (count % 2 === 1) ? useCustomB : useCustomA;`

_But this is highly error prone as number and order of hooks can change even for a single component instance as prop values are modified_

Please refer to the working sample implementation below

Please see the following React dev tools output for these 2 instances

I really appreciate any clarification on this

这是一个测试 issue，用来验证 GitHub API 的功能是否正常工作。

如果你看到这个 issue，说明 API 调用成功了！
