### Bug: eslint-plugin-react-hooks disallows the use of useId in async component even though it works

> Issue #31187 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31187)

In #27045 the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` has been modified to disallow the use of any hooks in `async` components, justified by this sentence:

> Hooks cannot be called in async functions, on either the client or the server. 

However, some hooks can be called in async components, namely `useId`. Or at least [the documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId) does not mention it[^1].

[^1]: [The documentation for React 19](https://19.react.dev/reference/react/useId) does not mention it as well.

React version: 18.3.1
eslint-plugin-react-hooks: 5.0.0

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Create an async component that uses `useId`
```tsx
export default async function Component() {
  const id = useId();
  return null;
}
```
2. ESLint will throw the following error: 
```console
Error: React Hook "useId" cannot be called in an async function.  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
```

## The current behavior

ESLint throws an error when an async component uses `useId`.

## The expected behavior

No ESLint error.

### Bug: Controlled state input weird behavior when state update is postponed to the next micro task

> Issue #31182 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31182)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version: v18.3

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Open the codesandbox link below
2. Add characters in the middle of each input
3. The first input works as expected. In the second input, the cursor will instantly jump to the end, also input methods will not work.

<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.

<!--
  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a
  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the
  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is
  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal
  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
-->

## The current behavior
By adding an additional queueMicrotask to the second input, two inputs behavior are different.

## The expected behavior
Work loop stuff should not affect DOM manipulation.

Is it a bug or feature? Is it a react stuff?
