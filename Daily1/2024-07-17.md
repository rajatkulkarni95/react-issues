Using Vite & React we're getting the weirdest error i've seen in all my react career:
```
Warning: div: `ref` is not a prop. Trying to access it will result in `undefined` being returned. If you need to access the same value within the child component, you should pass it as a different prop. (https://reactjs.org/link/special-props)
```

I'm clueless, how does react warn me that `ref` is not a prop for `<div>`?

Accompanied is a whole bunch of other errors related to contexts:
```
Warning: _RichTextEditor: `key` is not a prop.
Warning: Rendering <Context.Consumer.Provider> is not supported and will be removed in a future major release. Did you mean to render <Context.Provider> instead?
Warning: Rendering <Context.Consumer.Consumer> is not supported and will be removed in a future major release. Did you mean to render <Context.Consumer> instead?
```

React version: `18.3.1`

## Steps To Reproduce

We tried to reproduce it but it does not happen in a minimal example.
Please advice on tactics/methods to write a minimal reproducible to try and get this error. 

The component giving this error is rendering a `createPortal` to the `document.body`:

Large Node Tree With recursively rendered components and form elements just to show it's a complex application which I think is what contributes to why we can't replicated it.

### Bug: Weird Behavior of useCallback() hook When Variables or States Are defined before and after the Callback (ES5)

When using ES5 with React Hooks, defining one dependency above and another below `useCallback()` results in either partial updates or correct code execution (as if both dependencies are defined above). This inconsistent behavior disrupts the expected functionality of `useCallback()`, making it difficult to manage state updates reliably and leading to unpredictable results.

**The main question is why React exhibits this behavior when dependencies are defined in such a manner and what the implications of doing this might be for the application.**

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation: [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78753216/react-hooks-behavior-difference-when-using-variables-and-states-in-usecallback).

Broken code works 

## The expected behavior
It depends on the scenarios provided in the Stack Overflow question.
