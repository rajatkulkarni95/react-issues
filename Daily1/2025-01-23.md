### Bug: Fix Buffer - Write Chunks to Separate Buffers

> Issue #32176 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32176)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->
The bug happens when using ReactDOMFizzServer.renderToReadableStream to render big chunks of data. If a chunk is bigger than the buffer (default: 512 bytes), the buffer overflows or uses incomplete data. This causes wrong or cut-off output because the renderer doesn’t handle buffer size properly.

React version:
React 19.0.0

## Steps To Reproduce
1. Create a large chunk of data that is bigger than the buffer size.
2. Start processing the data using `ReactDOMFizzServer.renderToReadableStream`.  
3. Observe the behavior when the chunks exceed the buffer size.  

<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't

  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.
-->

<!--
  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a
  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the
  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is
  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal
  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
-->
```
import ReactDOMFizzServer from 'react-dom/server';

// Minimal data to reproduce the problem
const largeChunk = 'A'.repeat(2049); // A chunk exceeding  default 512 bytes

async function testStream() {
  //  simple React structure with the large chunk
  const stream = await ReactDOMFizzServer.renderToReadableStream(
    <div>{largeChunk}</div>
  );

  // function to read the stream
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();
  const reader = stream.getReader();
  let result = '';
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;
    result += decoder.decode(value);
  }

  console.log(result);
}

testStream();
```

## The current behavior
Right now, when chunks are sent to a `ReadableStream`, they are enqueued directly without checking the buffer size. If a chunk is too big (like 2049 bytes, while the buffer is only 512 bytes), it reuses old buffers, which messes up the output. For example, instead of properly rendering, we get something like ```<div>AAAAA...</div>```.

## The expected behavior
Chunks should be written to their own buffer and split into smaller parts if they are too big. The buffer should only be sent once it's full or the writing is complete. This way, even large chunks (like 2049 bytes) will render correctly, for example: ```<div>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...</div>```.

### Bug: Ensure createRoot warning parity with ReactDOM.render

> Issue #32175 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32175)

Ensure createRoot warning parity with ReactDOM.render

### Description

This PR addresses an internal task to bring over some pre-existing warnings for `ReactDOM.render()` to `createRoot()`, ensuring parity in warning behavior. Specifically, warnings related to failing to clear an existing React tree should now also trigger for roots.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use `ReactDOM.render()` with a non-empty container.
2. Use `createRoot()` with a non-empty container.
3. Observe that warnings for `ReactDOM.render()` appear, but not for `createRoot()`.

### Expected Behavior

Warnings for failing to clear the React tree should trigger for both `ReactDOM.render()` and `createRoot()`.

### Actual Behavior

Warnings appear only for `ReactDOM.render()` and not for `createRoot()`.

### Environment

- React Version: 16.13.0
- Browser: Chrome
- Node Version: 12.18.0

### Bug: Inconsistent enhanced error messages for incorrect hook calls

> Issue #32174 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32174)

<!--
  PR #18480 included new error messages for invalid hook calls, but they don't always show up the way they should. The error message may not show up in some situations or may be ambiguous or inconsistent.
-->

React version: React 18.0.0 (also tested with React 19 beta)

## Steps To Reproduce

1.Use a React hook (like useState) outside of a custom hook or functional component.
2.Launch the program and look for error messages in the console.


Link to code example: https://codesandbox.io/s/new


## The current behavior
The message of error:

does not show up in certain situations.
appears, but offers no clear or practical advice on the matter.



## The expected behavior
The error message ought to:

When hooks are utilized improperly, they always show up.
Give precise, succinct, and doable instructions for fixing the problem.

### Bug: Hydration Gaps and Dropped Events in Concurrent and Suspense Hydration

> Issue #32173 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32173)

<!--
 There is a delay between calling createRoot or createSyncRoot and committing the hydrated tree, leading to gaps in rendering. During these gaps, events issued on dehydrated DOM nodes are dropped. This issue is more prominent in batched and concurrent modes, where there are delays in starting the render or during yielding. For Suspense boundaries, Partial Hydration also introduces gaps between rendering levels. This problem prevents certain user events from being handled correctly until after the tree is fully hydrated.
-->

React version: 2.3.1

## Steps To Reproduce

1.Use React with Suspense boundaries or in concurrent mode.
2.Trigger events (e.g., click, text input) during the hydration gap
3.Observe that some events are not handled or are dropped.

      const [hydrated, setHydrated] = useState(false);

      // Simulate the hydration process
      useEffect(() => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          setHydrated(true);
        }, 3000); // Delay for 3 seconds (simulating hydration gap)
      }, []);

      // Handle a click event that will be missed during the hydration gap
      const handleClick = () => {
        alert("Button clicked!");
      };

      if (!hydrated) {
        // Show a placeholder or loading state while waiting for hydration
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
      }

      // This button will miss the first click event if clicked before hydration is done
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>
        </div>
      );
    };

    const App = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Hydration Gap Example</h1>
          <DelayedComponent />
        </div>
      );
    };

    // Initially render the component server-side (SSRed content)
    ReactDOM.hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

    // Simulate a client-side hydration
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      ReactDOM.hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>



Steps to Reproduce the Bug:
Initial Render:

The page renders with the message "Loading..." and the button appears after a 3-second delay. During this period, the component is "not hydrated."
User Interaction:

If the user clicks the button before the component is hydrated (within the 3-second delay), the event will be dropped or missed because the button is still in the "dehydrated" state.
Component Hydration:

After the delay, the component becomes hydrated and ready to handle events properly. Any further clicks will work as expected.


-->

Link to code example:

<!--
  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Simulate a delay in rendering (such as in Concurrent Mode or Suspense boundaries)
const DelayedComponent = () => {
  const [hydrated, setHydrated] = useState(false);

  // Simulate the hydration process
  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setHydrated(true);
    }, 3000); // Delay for 3 seconds (simulating hydration gap)
  }, []);

  // Handle a click event that will be missed during the hydration gap
  const handleClick = () => {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  };

  if (!hydrated) {
    // Show a placeholder or loading state while waiting for hydration
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  // This button will miss the first click event if clicked before hydration is done
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hydration Gap Example</h1>
      <DelayedComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

// Initially render the component server-side (SSRed content)
ReactDOM.hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// For the sake of example, simulating a client-side hydration
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  ReactDOM.hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
});

-->

## The current behavior
Critical user interactions should be handled immediately, while less critical interactions can be replayed after hydration.

## The expected behavior
ome events are dropped due to the hydration gap, leading to a degraded user experience, especially with client-side interactions.

// Expectation: An error mentioning that the container is invalid.
```
## The current behavior
When an invalid container is passed to `createRoot()`, the function does not validate it. 
```
Cannot call toLowerCase of undefined
```
## The expected behavior
The createRoot() function should validate the container and show error.
```
unstable_createRoot(...): Target container is not a DOM element.
```

### Bug: sample test

> Issue #32169 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32169)

<!--

-->Currently, suspended nodes in React are hidden using display: none inline style. However, this is susceptible to being overridden by external styles. The new approach applies display: none !important, ensuring React's visibility style takes precedence and preserves the state of hidden components.

React version: 16.8.6

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Trigger a suspended state in a React component.
2. Apply an external stylesheet that includes a display: block !important rule targeting the component's DOM node.
3. Observe that external styles can override the inline display: none.
