### Unexpected Initial State Jump in 'useEffect" with 'setTimeout' and State Dependencies

> Issue #30176 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30176)

**Description**:
When using `useEffect` in React with a state variable in the dependency array and a `setTimeout` function inside the effect, the initial state update causes an unexpected jump from `0` to `2` within the first interval period. This behavior deviates from the expected incremental update and can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Create a component with the following code:
    ```javascript
    import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

    function Temp() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      useEffect(() => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          setCount((count) => count + 1);
        }, 5000);
      }, [count]);

      return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>;
    }

    export default Temp;
    ```
2. Render the `Temp` component.
3. Observe the `count` value after the first timeout period (5 seconds).

**Expected Behavior**:
The `count` should increment from `0` to `1` after the first 5-second interval and continue incrementing by `1` every subsequent 5-second interval.

**Actual Behavior**:
The `count` jumps from `0` to `2` within the first 5-second interval, and then increments correctly by `1` every subsequent 5-second interval.

**Explanation**:
This unexpected jump occurs due to the way React handles state updates and effect executions. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:
1. **Initial Render**:
   - `count` is initialized to `0`.
   - `useEffect` schedules a `setTimeout` to increment `count` after 5 seconds.

2. **First Timeout Execution** (after 5 seconds):
   - The `setTimeout` callback executes and increments `count` from `0` to `1`.
   - This state change triggers a re-render of the component.
   - `useEffect` runs again because `count` is in the dependency array, scheduling another `setTimeout` for 5 seconds.

3. **State Update and Re-render**:
   - React processes the state update, causing the component to re-render with `count` set to `1`.
   - The re-render triggers `useEffect` again, scheduling another `setTimeout` almost immediately.

React batches state updates and effect re-runs to optimize performance. This batching can result in both the initial state update (from `0` to `1`) and the next `setTimeout` scheduling occurring within the same event loop tick. Consequently, the `setTimeout` callback executes twice in quick succession:
1. The first `setTimeout` increments `count` from `0` to `1` after 5 seconds.
2. The state update triggers a re-render, and `useEffect` schedules another `setTimeout` immediately due to the new `count` value (`1`).
3. The second `setTimeout` increments `count` from `1` to `2` almost immediately.

**Impact**:
- **Developer Confusion**: The unexpected behavior can lead to confusion, especially for developers new to React or those expecting consistent interval updates.
- **Potential Bugs**: Misunderstanding this behavior can lead to bugs in applications, particularly in scenarios requiring precise timing or consistent state updates.
- **Increased Complexity**: Developers need to add additional logic to handle this case, increasing the complexity of the code.

**Suggested Improvements**:
1. **Documentation**: Enhance the React documentation to explicitly mention this behavior and provide guidelines on how to handle it.
2. **Development Warnings**: Introduce development-time warnings for common patterns that might lead to this behavior, suggesting alternative patterns or solutions.
3. **API Enhancements**: Consider API enhancements that provide a more intuitive handling of such scenarios, potentially through built-in mechanisms for managing intervals and timeouts predictably.

I hope that by addressing this issue, you can make state updates and effect handling more intuitive and predictable, thereby enhancing the overall developer experience.

### [React 19] Cannot assign to readonly property

> Issue #30172 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30172)

## Summary

<!--
  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a
  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the
  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is
  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal
  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
-->

I'm using https://waku.gg to use react components. I was trying to upgrade to the latest 19 rc and I started getting getting this error:

![image](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/1192452/c8452687-af93-48cf-a549-5cb20d6354ed)

I boiled down the app into just a few file to demonstrate the issue [here](https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/waku-repro/)

The issue is as follow:

```tsx
// Client context Provider
import { StoryContextProvider } from "../../components/Context";
// Server Component
import A11yDecorator from "../../A11yDecorator";
// Client Component
import CenteredDecorator from "../../CenteredDecorator";

export default function Iframe() {
  const page = {};

  return (
    <StoryContextProvider value={{ page }}>
      <CenteredDecorator page={page}>
        <A11yDecorator page={page}>
          foo
        </A11yDecorator>
      </CenteredDecorator>
    </StoryContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Some observations:

- If I switch the order of `A11yDecorator` and `CenteredDecorator`, the app renders
- If I don't use a shared `page` variable and just pass objects to the relevant places, the app renders
- If I spread the `page` and make an new object when passing to the relevant places, the app renders

### Bug: Empty `style={}` object values cause hydration warnings in React 18.3.1 - Includes solution

> Issue #30163 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30163)

# Issue

Hydrating a React 18 application with a `style={}` prop object with empty values results in a hydration warning:

```jsx
function App() {
  const style = {
    color: "red",
    // Empty style value i.e. from conditional assignment.
    "--empty-custom-property": "",
  };

  return <p style={style}>Hello World</p>;
}
```

Repro: https://github.com/nandastone/react-18-19-ssr-empty-style

In the example above, the client generates a style object containing a property with an empty string value. This does not match the expected ReactDOM behavior which discards style object properties with empty values:

![CleanShot 2024-07-01 at 21 01 47@2x](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/199204/996a4f8c-62f0-4b00-bbb1-2b714e0948c3)

Example: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/objective-tesla-nzsvwz?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js%3A8%2C1

#  Culprit

The issue lies in a line in the development-mode hydration check, called during `diffHydratedProperties()`: [CSSPropertyOperations.js#L33](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v18.3.1/packages/react-dom/src/client/CSSPropertyOperations.js#L33)

This check does not match the stricter ReactDOM implementation that correctly discards properties with empty values: [dangerousStyleValue.js#L31](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v18.3.1/packages/react-dom/src/shared/dangerousStyleValue.js#L31)

# Solution

Update `createDangerousStringForStyles()` to match the ReactDOM implementation. This was addressed in React 19: [CSSPropertyOperations.js#L34](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/CSSPropertyOperations.js#L34).

However, many applications (including mine) will be using React 18 for a while, so it would be good to fix this issue. Although the contributing guidelines suggest that all PRs should target `main`, is there a way to open a PR targeting the v18.3.1 tag?

React version: 18.3.1

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Render a component with a style prop where the object has a property with empty string value.
2. Render the app using a React 18 server API e.g. `renderToPipeableStream()`.
3. Hydrate the app.

Link to code example:

https://github.com/nandastone/react-18-19-ssr-empty-style

1. Clone.
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn start`
4. http://localhost:9000

Unfortunately Codesandbox/Stackblitz were proving difficult to properly setup the SSR example.

## The current behavior

Receive hydration warning.

## The expected behavior

Should not receive hydration warning.

### Bug: Error Recovery Mechanism Overwriting Initial Rendering Errors in Concurrent Mode

> Issue #30157 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30157)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version:18

I have encountered an issue with the error recovery mechanism in Concurrent Mode (React 18's Concurrent Features), where initial rendering errors seem to be overwritten by subsequent errors triggered in side effects, making it difficult to debug and trace the original error.

## Steps To Reproduce

1.Create a component that intentionally throws an error during rendering.
Include a side effect (e.g., data fetching or model updating) that only triggers an error when React attempts to recover from the initial rendering error.
2.The Main component throws an error during rendering.
The useOnce hook calls a function which updates a global variable and throws an error on subsequent updates.

```
import React, { useRef, Component } from "react";

let a = null;

const updateA = () => {
  console.log("updateA");
  if (a) {
    throw "a has updated";
  }
  a = 1;
};

function useOnce(callback) {
  const hasRun = useRef(false);
  if (!hasRun.current) {
    callback();
    hasRun.current = true;
  }
}
export default function Main() {
  useOnce(() => {
    updateA();
  });
  throw "1111111";

  return null;
}
```
<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.
