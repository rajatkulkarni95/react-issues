### Bug: useOptimistic

> Issue #31708 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31708)

React version:19.0.0
[I got example from react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic) slightly modified it.
 
Now `key` attribute derive value from data (message)
```
        <div key={message.id}>
          {message.text}
          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}
        </div>
```

## Steps To Reproduce

1.[Open link](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-dev-forked-5hddwt)
2.Send new message
3.Open console

## The current behavior
On the image below we can see duplicating list of messages from [I got example from react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic).

There was no error in [I got example from react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic) because `key` gets values from `index`, `index` is always unique.

        <div key={index}>
          {message.text}
          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}
        </div>

Code that is slightly modified by me print out following (from console):

> Encountered two children with the same key, `8908d3a9-13b7-4576-bf85-e850f7ab2c1c`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version

I don't know the reason of that behaviour but I see that `updateFn` in `useOptimistic` is called with `new message` twice:
1. First time after `addOptimisticMessage` is called, 
2. Second time while `Thread` component is re-rendered.

### Bug: memory leak caused by alternate fiber tree

> Issue #31705 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31705)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version: 19

## Steps To Reproduce

```typescript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [obj, setObj] = useState<any>({});
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const refresh = useCallback(() => {
    const newObj = {
      buffer: new Uint8Array(100_000_000),
      count: count + 1,
    };
    setObj(newObj);
    setCount((pre) => pre + 1);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={refresh}>new obj({count})</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## The current behavior
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/503bfa91-0bae-46cd-a4d7-a103f8cd4e2f">

## The expected behavior
release the `memoizedState` / `baseState` of alternate fiber tree.

## Confusion
I know it's not a good way to store a big state using `useState`. But it's a bug or some feature?
