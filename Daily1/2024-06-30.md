I was trying to use React Devtools but i was not able to use it as you can see it in pictures. I thought it was cause i was using vite to create my react project, but i didnt work either in cra app. I saw the error when i navigated to the sources tab as you can see in second picture which is as follows:

`Could not load content for webpack:///react-devtools-shared/src/backend/console.js (Fetch through target failed: Unsupported URL scheme; Fallback: HTTP error: status code 404, net::ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME)`
