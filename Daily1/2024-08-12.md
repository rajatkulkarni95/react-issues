### Bug: in chrome version  127.0.6533.100 and the previous release, debugger hangs on breakpoint, when attempting to interact with values

> Issue #30664 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30664)

Starting with the version ending in .88 and in  127.0.6533.100, the react devtool plugin hangs when a breakpoint is hit and you attempt to hover over any variables in the current scope, where the break happened.   You can briefly scroll the right panel with the mouse wheel, but fairly soon that goes away too.  If you immediately press continue, the code continues to run.  Otherwise, you have to press F12 to remove the debugger and press F12 again to restart it.  The other tabs seem to function normally, but the ability to set breakpoints and inspect elements is very broken


React version:
Extension 5.3.1, react 17.02

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Set a breakpoint
2. Reach the breakpoint.
3. Attempt to inspect elements  in the current scope.
4. Find the debugger is now hung and will not interact with the mouse.

I don't have a code example, it doesn't seem to be dependent on any particular code, it behaves the same in every part of our application; set a breakpoint, hit it, and you are stuck.


## The current behavior
Debugger hangs upon stopping at a breakpoint

## The expected behavior
Debugger allows user to inspect code and variables when hitting a breakpoint.

### Bug: React refresh fails when component type is changed to memo or forward ref and vice versa

> Issue #30659 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30659)

when Editing a JSX component, if we try to move from a normal React component to a memo Wrapped component,  or to a forwardRef wrapped, we cannot see any component rendered, but rather an error  ```Uncaught TypeError: Component is not a function```

this seems to be an issue with React refresh since if we try to reload the page, the component renders fine without any issue.

if we start with a code like below

```
import { forwardRef, memo } from "react";

export function Component() {
   return <h1>This is a component</h1>;
}

```

and then edit it to 

```

export const Component = memo(function Test() {
  return <h1>This is a memo component</h1>;
});

```

the error comes up




React version: 18.2.0

## Steps To Reproduce
[CodesandBoxLink](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/relaxed-clarke-6tty7m)

1. Visit the Sandbox URL
2. try editing the Component File
3. the initial render is of a normal Component
4. comment out the Normal component and uncomment the Memo wrapped component
5. it does not render instead if you check the console you would see an error
6. try commenting the Memo out and then check the ForwardRef, the same thing happens


Link to code example:
[CodesandBoxLink](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/relaxed-clarke-6tty7m)

if the codeSandBox is not able to reproduce the same due to some reason, try cloning the below repository
https://github.com/Biki-das/ReactRefreshBug

## The current behavior

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e691ebf-38d1-4c05-9585-c5292aab5563


## The expected behavior
React refresh should have work and the component should have rendered.
