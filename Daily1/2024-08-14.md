### [React 19] Conditionally rendered suspendable component using `use()` shows fallback even if promise already resolved

> Issue #30701 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30701)

## Summary
I'm trying the new `use()` hook over promises. I found that the suspense will show the fallback if the call to `use()` is delayed, even if the promise already resolved prior to `use`ing it. Namely, Suspense always renders the fallback initially, even if the component never suspends. 

Interestingly, if I `use` the promise in a sibling component, this issue is not present even on the first suspense component.

## Reproduction
[Here's a minimal reproducible example](https://github.com/mordechaim/lazy-suspense).

<details>
<summary>Code backup</summary>

```ts

import { Suspense, use, useMemo, useState } from 'react';

export function App() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  const promise = useMemo(
    () =>
      new Promise<string>((resolve) => {
        console.log('starting promise');

        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log('resolving promise');

          resolve('hello');
        }, 5000);
      }),
    []
  );

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Reveal</button>
        {open && (
          <Suspense fallback='still loading...'>
            <SuspendableGreeting promise={promise} />
          </Suspense>
        )}
      </div>

      {/* Uncommenting the below code will fixed the issue above */}
      {/* <Suspense fallback='loading'>
        <Resolve promise={promise} />
      </Suspense> */}
    </>
  );
}

interface SuspendableProps {
  promise: Promise<string>;
}

function SuspendableGreeting({ promise }: SuspendableProps) {
  const greeting = use(promise);
  return greeting;
}

function Resolve({ promise }: SuspendableProps) {
  use(promise);
  return null;
}
```
</details>



1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open the page and DevTools
3. Wait 5 seconds for the message "resolving promise" to print
4. Press "Reveal"

### Bug: No "exports" in use-sync-external-store package.json

> Issue #30698 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30698)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

React version: 16.9

This is less of a critical error and more of suggestion to fix issue/non-ideal-scenario with certain webpack builds. I did not have permission to push a branch to this repo to make PR with.

## Steps To Reproduce

1. `import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'use-sync-external-store/shim';` in a library that uses `"type":"module"` in its package.json, and is then imported into an application built with webpack 5.
    - Be using webpack 5 _without_ setting `resolve: { fullySpecified: false }` in webpack config's module.rules[].resolve.
2. Receive an error:
     > BREAKING CHANGE: The request 'use-sync-external-store/shim' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified (probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e.g. a module with javascript mimetype, a "*.mjs" file, or a "*.js" file where the package contains '"type": "module"').

<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.

We have such an import line in our code. We also have an ESLint rule to prevent fully specified imports and do not want to make an exception. I would like to propose adding 'exports' to the [package.json in use-sync-external-store](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/use-sync-external-store/package.json) containing the following or similar:

```json
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "default": "./index.js"
    },
    "./package.json": "./package.json",
    "./shim": {
      "default": "./shim/index.js"
    }
  }
```
(used [react's package.json](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react/package.json#L24) as basis)

Have tested the above inside own project's node_modules/use-sync-external-store/package.json and confirmed this fixes the build error without needing to add in `resolve: { fullySpecified: false }` nor fully specify the path. Did not need package.json export, and did not need or test the "." export.

### Bug: Object.keys inside the Shallow Equal can be improved 

> Issue #30687 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30687)

if we look at this file https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/shared/shallowEqual.js
which is a utility for shallowEqual, in this code we are using Object.keys() method,  i tried to have this method working without Object.keys() , which does not create intermediate arrays.

this actually has a near around 30% better performance in the comparison loop we are trying to do, now that can be something that varies from browser to browser, and also due to many other factors, but would love to know the opinion of the maintainers of the same of what they think about, i am attaching a JS benchmark which calculates the benchmark for the both piece of code.



React version: 18.2.0

## Steps To Reproduce

1. check the JS benchmark https://jsben.ch/d9SVb
2. click on run tests

The code block 2 contains the piece of code which does not uses Object.keys() and is much faster.




https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fbe9850-8f4d-4de4-be15-96bff5db10dd





**Current Code**

```
function shallowEqual(objA, objB) {
  if (is(objA, objB)) {
    return true;
  }

  if (
    typeof objA !== 'object' ||
    objA === null ||
    typeof objB !== 'object' ||
    objB === null
  ) {
    return false;
  }

  const keysA = Object.keys(objA);
  const keysB = Object.keys(objB);

  if (keysA.length !== keysB.length) {
    return false;
  }

  // Test for A's keys different from B.
  for (let i = 0; i < keysA.length; i++) {
    const currentKey = keysA[i];
    if (
      !hasOwnProperty.call(objB, currentKey) ||
      !is(objA[currentKey], objB[currentKey])
    ) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
for(let i = 0; i <= 1000; i++){

shallowEqual(a, b);
}

```

**Code that has a  better performance**

```
function shallowEqual(objA, objB) {
  if (is(objA, objB)) {
    return true;
  }

  if (
    typeof objA !== 'object' ||
    objA === null ||
    typeof objB !== 'object' ||
    objB === null
  ) {
    return false;
  }
 let aLength = 0;
  let bLength = 0;

  for (const key in objA) {
    aLength += 1;

    if (!hasOwnProperty.call(objB, key) || !is(objA[key], objB[key])) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  for (const _ in objB) {
    bLength += 1;
  }

  return aLength === bLength;
}
 for(let i = 0; i <= 1000; i++){
shallowEqual(a, b);
 }


```
