React version: reproduced on 17 and 18

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Create an input like this: `<input text="move the selection around" onSelect={console.log} type="email" />`
2. Move the selection around and see that onSelect is emitted only on focus and blur. Notice that you get normal behavior if you remove the type

### Bug: Sidebar Dropdown Doesn't Close on 

> Issue #31155 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31155)


When clicking on a sidebar option that triggers a dropdown menu, the dropdown opens as expected. However, clicking the same option again does not close (toggle off) the dropdown. The dropdown remains visible, and the expected behavior of closing the dropdown on the second click does not occur.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b6c3080-0483-4f61-8658-6658d5b7c5a9)


React version: 18.3.1

## Steps To Reproduce

1.Click on the sidebar option to open the dropdown menu.
2.Click on the same sidebar option again to close the dropdown menu.


## The current behavior
When the sidebar button is clicked, the dropdown menu opens as expected. However, clicking the button again does not close the dropdown, which results in the menu remaining open and the user unable to toggle it off.


## The expected behavior
Clicking the sidebar button a second time should close the dropdown menu, toggling it off. The dropdown should behave as a proper toggle: opening on the first click and closing on the second click.

### Bug: Suspense Update Yields Too Willingly in Concurrent Mode

> Issue #31149 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31149)

## Summary

**React Version:** 18.2.0 (also tested in 19 RC)

After transitioning from the legacy renderer to the concurrent renderer, we've encountered an issue with render delays when using `React.lazy` to lazily load a sub-application. This sub-app is a crucial component of our UI, and without it, the page is essentially non-functional.

- **Legacy Renderer:** Everying works as expected with no issues.
- **Concurrent Renderer:** Lazy loading works, but there's a significant delay in render time.

## Business Context

As illustrated in the diagram below, the sub-app occupies the majority of the page. Currently, server-side rendering is not implemented for this page, so it relies on client-side rendering to determine which sub-app should be lazy-loaded.

The sub-app is the most crucial component of this page. Therefore, once the `import()` resolves, we'd like to prioritize rendering this component over any other task.

Given that this page is a large-scale product involving many engineers, transitioning to SSR is a challenging task.

+----+-----------------------------------------------+
```
## Steps To Reproduce
```tsx
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { ExpensiveComponent } from "./App";

let resolve: (value?: unknown) => void;
const promise = new Promise((res) => {
  resolve = res;
});

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(async () => {
  await promise;
  return { default: ExpensiveComponent }; // ExpensiveComponent is very slow to render
});

test("Suspense", async () => {
  render(
    <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </React.Suspense>
  );
  // expect fallback rendered here
  expect(screen.getByText(/Loading/i)).toBeInTheDocument(); 

  // resolve lazy component
  resolve?.();

  // wait for current event loop to clear
  await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 0));

  // In legacy renderer, ExpensiveComponent is fully rendered and committed here
  // In concurrent renderer, ExpensiveComponent is not fully rendered yet
});
```

## Investigation Findings

- In concurrent mode, when the lazy component is resolved, the Suspense boundary attempts to update in a retry lane using `requestRetryLane`.
- In concurrent mode, this retry lane is assigned the lowest priority, causing React to yield too willingly and resulting in render delays.
- The use of `flushSync` to prioritize rendering does not affect `requestRetryLane`, preventing us from prioritizing the lazy component for mounting in `SyncLane`.

## Question/Request

Could we have an option to prioritize specific `React.lazy` or Suspense components? Prioritizing our sub-app component is crucial because of its essential role in our page's functionality and performance needs.

We look forward to any insights, workarounds, or plans for this kind of prioritization feature in React.

Thank you for your continued efforts in improving React and for your support.
