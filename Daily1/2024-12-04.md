### Bug: useState apply updaters order does not comply with the documentation

> Issue #31670 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31670)

React version: 16 & 18

## Steps To Reproduce
1. Call setState(functional updater) twice
2. One of the updater will be calculated before re-render.

Link to code example: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/quizzical-hugle-wsp7zh

## The expected behavior
As per the [documentation of setState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#setstate),
> If you pass a function as nextState, it will be treated as an updater function. It must be pure, should take the pending state as its only argument, and should return the next state. 
> **React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state.**

Expected behaviour is,
1. click on the button
2. enqueue two updater actions
3. the App component re-renders
4. (when visiting useState) apply two actions
5. get the updated new value
 
## The current behavior
However the current behavior is,
1. click on the button
2. one of the actions is calculated IMMEDIATELY, the rest are enqueued.
3. the App component re-renders
4. (when visiting useState) apply the remaining actions
5. get the updated new value

## Note
Only the *first* time not complying. From the second time it works expectedly.

### Bug: React 18 setState behaves differently when before and after Promise.resolve().then

> Issue #31669 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31669)

The number of renders is different in React 18 when used before or after `Promise.resolve().then`. Here are the two examples:

````
  const handleClick = async () => {
    console.log(0);
    setV((v) => {
      console.log("y");
      return v + 1;
    });
    Promise.resolve().then(() => {
      console.log(1);
      setV((v) => {
        console.log("x");
        return v + 1;
      });
      console.log(2);
      Promise.resolve().then(() => {
        console.log(3);
      });
    });
    console.log(4);
    console.log(5);
  };

  const handleClick2 = async () => {
    console.log(0);
    Promise.resolve().then(() => {
      console.log(1);
      setV((v) => {
        console.log("x");
        return v + 1;
      });
      console.log(2);
      Promise.resolve().then(() => {
        console.log(3);
      });
    });
    console.log(4);
    setV((v) => {
      console.log("y");
      return v + 1;
    });
    console.log(5);
  };
```` 
 
`handleClick` causes two renders.
`handleClick2` causes one render.

React version: 18
