### [Compiler Bug]: Increment expression in for-loop loses assignment operation

> Issue #29956 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29956)

### What kind of issue is this?

- [X] React Compiler core (the JS output is incorrect, or your app works incorrectly after optimization)
- [ ] babel-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the Babel plugin)
- [ ] eslint-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the eslint plugin)
- [ ] react-compiler-healthcheck (build issue installing or using the healthcheck script)

### Repro steps

In our repo we have code similar to the Playground link posted above which when compiled loses the assignment part of the increment expression.

The original code:
```
          for (
            let node: LexicalNode | null = selection.anchor.getNode();
            node && !$isRootNode(node);
            node = node.getParent()
          ) {
```

Compiled to this code:
```
        for (let node5 = selection.anchor.getNode(); node5 && !$isRootNode2(node5); node5.getParent()) {
```

Happy to provide additional information or context if needed, thanks!

### [React 19] Inconsistent "cache" api with Async Operations in react-server

> Issue #29955 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29955)

**Description:**

When running the provided code with `node`, I encounter an issue where the cache is inconsistent depending on whether an async operation is present.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run the following code with `node`:

```typescript
const { renderToReadableStream } = require("react-server-dom-webpack/server.edge");
const { cache, createElement } = require("react");

const getId = cache(() => ({ id: Math.random() }));

const A = async () => {
    await new Promise(setImmediate);
    const id = getId();
    console.log(id);
    return null;
};

const B = async () => {
    const id = getId();
    console.log(id);
    return createElement(A, {}, null);
};

renderToReadableStream(createElement(B, {}, null), null);
```

2. Observe the console output. The `id` values logged in `A` and `B` are different.
3. Modify the code to remove the `await new Promise(setImmediate);` line from `A`:

```typescript
const A = async () => {
  const id = getId();
  console.log(id);
  return null;
};
```

4. Run the modified code with `node` again.
5. Observe the console output. The `id` values logged in `A` and `B` are now the same.

**Expected Behavior:**

The `id` values should be consistent regardless of the presence of async operations during the render.

**Actual Behavior:**

The `id` values are different when an async operation is present in the render method.

**Reproduction Code:**

You can run the code using the following command:

```
npm run start
```

or a codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/p/github/nestarz/react-19-cache-issue/main?import=true
and the github repo: https://github.com/nestarz/react-19-cache-issue

**Additional Information:**

It seems there might be an issue with the request context propagation when async operations are involved during the render process. This leads to inconsistent behavior which could cause unpredictable bugs.

**Environment:**
- `node` v20.8.1
```json
{
  "name": "test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node --conditions react-server index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^19.0.0-rc-e684ca66ab-20240619",
    "react-server-dom-webpack": "^19.0.0-rc-e684ca66ab-20240619"
  }
}
```

It impacts the consistency and reliability of cache in async rendering scenarios, and it's critical when used as an alternative to server context, is this normal ? Thank you!

### Bug:  DoS vulnerability in ws dependency

> Issue #29953 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29953)

`react-devtools-core` has `ws` as a dependency and in release 8.17.1 `ws` have issued a fix to a DoS vulnerability ([link](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/8.17.1)). Would it be possible to upgrade to use this version of `ws`?

(Apologies if I have filed this in the incorrect place, but I was unclear on where these issues should be raised.)

React version: React DevTools 5.3.0

## Steps To Reproduce

Link to code example:

## The current behavior
NA

## The expected behavior
NA

### The const array variable value populated in a function does not reflect the updated values when called in another function in Firefox

> Issue #29947 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29947)

I have created a sample React application in which an const array variable is populated with values in rowDataBoundEvent function, but when I try to access the array variable value in another function `dataBoundEvent` in console it comes empty. This issue occurs only in Firefox but works fine in both Chrome and Edge browsers.

React version: 18.1

## Steps To Reproduce

1. In the following sample, I have displayed the array variable value once the dataBound event is triggered.
2. You can find that the arrayVal variable gives empty value.

Link to code example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-jmv77v-ycnlvj?file=index.js

Firefox:
![image](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/93654184/a6cb3b0f-2c46-4087-a12b-5ae374e72a05)

Edge:
![image](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/93654184/2c60cd62-cfd4-4344-9395-2f8c3176d876)

## The current behavior
The array variable value populated in a function does not reflect the value updated in another function in Firefox

## The expected behavior
The array variable value populated in a function should reflect the value updated in another function in Firefox similar to chrome and edge browsers.

### [React 19] infinite loop when using React lazy & functional formAction together.

> Issue #29930 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29930)

## Summary

### Version
"react": "19.0.0-rc-107a2f8c3e-20240617",
"react-dom": "19.0.0-rc-107a2f8c3e-20240617"
OS : windows 11
Chrome : 125.0.6422.142

### Overview
We have a great feature 'functional form action' in react 19.
`<form action={functionalFormAction}`
<br>

but with React lazy, it doesn't seem to work properly.
It causes infinite loop depends on its use cases.

![image](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/17701725/bd5e67a6-e990-45b8-a57a-531e81617863)

<br>

1. case1 : infinite loop (React lazy without `<Suspense/>`. All dynamic codes are inside form component)
2. case2 : no infinite loop (React lazy with `<Suspense/>`. All dynamic codes are inside form component)
3. case3 : infinite loop (React lazy with `<Suspsne />` & has dependency on useFormStatus. All dynamic code are inside form component)

### Related Issues
#29235 Bug: Nested lazy components cause rerendering
#27573 Bug: Nested components imported with React.lazy cause rerendering

### Reproduction
Go to [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/devbox-test-hhr-zm6z3k?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%3A11%2C46)
Try Case2 at first, (submit form by clicking button)
Try Case3 at second, (it causes infinite loop so it makes js blocked)
Try Case1 at the last (it causes infinite loop so it makes js blocked)
