### [React 19] Signal & Observable

> Issue #30570 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30570)

## Summary

There is huge discussion about Signals and Observables, Solid.js is built upon Signals, highly popular library like `react-use` has `useObservable` util hook.

"Recently", a [Signals proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals) appeared and quickly drew attention.

## Proposal

I thought it would be really handy if React would have a way to support this kind of structure - observe the state. I know there is `useSyncExternalStore`, but the signature is a little bit different and it can't be used in conditionals.

So if something like that would work... I would expect the following to work

```tsx
import { use } from "react"
import { searchSignal } from "@/signals"

function Images() {
	const search = use(searchSignal)

	return (...)
}

function App() {
	return (
		<SearchBar />
		<Images />
	)
}

function SearchBar() {
	return <input onChange={event => searchSignal.set(event.currentTarget.value)} />
}
```

## Explanation

The Signal itself is an abstraction, which only implements `get` method and `subscribe` from [this proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable).

The `use` hook would have the following signature

```ts
interface Getter<T> {
	get?(): T
}

interface Observable<T> {
	subscribe?(): { unsubscribe(): void }
}

function use<T>(... | Getter<T> | Observable<T> | (Getter<T> & Observable<T>)): T
```

The `Getter` and `Observable` could work in tandem to allow getting initial value while listening for further updates.

Not sure about `use`, it might be better to implement completely standalone hook like `useSignal` or `useObservable`.
Not sure if this was already discussed and proposed, I couldn't find any related topics.

### Bug: Setting the state to the same value causes a re-render.

> Issue #30558 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30558)

React version: 18.3.1

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Set the initial state to false.
2. Change the state to true.
3. Set the state to true once more.

Link to code example: [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/rerendering-6njfxk)

```
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Child = () => {
  console.log("Child");
  return null;
};

export default function App() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(false);
  console.log("App");
  return (
    <>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setState(true);
        }}
      >
        click
      </button>
      <Child />
    </>
  );
}
```

## The current behavior
1. Print 'App' and 'Child' on the first rendering.
2. Clicking the <button /> prints 'App' and 'Child'.
3. Clicking the <button /> once more prints 'App'.

## The expected behavior
1. Print 'App' and 'Child' on the first rendering.
2. Clicking the <button /> prints 'App' and 'Child'.
3. Clicking the <button /> one more time results in no reaction.

I think this issue occurred because the previous current(now alternate)'s `lanes` was not cleared after reconciliation.

I confirmed that when the button was clicked a second time, the `lanes` was not `NoLanes`, so it did not compare with the previous state and immediately scheduled the rendering.
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v18.3.1/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.new.js#L2257-L2287

Since there were no updates during the rendering of the App component, it bailed out of rendering, so the children were not re-rendered.
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v18.3.1/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.new.js#L1047-L1050

However, if the `lanes` of the previous fiber had been cleared, such rendering would not have occurred.

I thought "If the state doesn't change, no re-rendering occurs", but I'm confused by the above result.

Is this a bug, or is there another reason for this behavior?
