### [React 19] `findDOMNode` is removed, with no suitable replacement for text nodes

> Issue #31836 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31836)

## Summary

In React 18 and below, the only way to obtain a reference to a text node rendered by a React component is with `findDOMNode`. [The docs](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/findDOMNode#adding-a-wrapper-div-element) indicated that the reason `findDOMNode` hadn't been removed was because there were no alternatives to use cases like this.

This seems like an extremely narrow edge case (why would you need a ref to a text node, right?), but [@nytimes/react-prosemirror](https://github.com/nytimes/react-prosemirror) is heavily reliant on this API. Because this is a rich text editing library, we can't wrap text nodes with ref-able elements without introducing complexity/edge cases.

What should we do here? I understand the desire to remove a long-deprecated API, but React ProseMirror is now somewhat in a lurch.

A simplified version of how React ProseMirror uses `findDOMNode`:

```ts
export class TextNodeView extends Component<Props> {
  private viewDescRef: null | TextViewDesc | CompositionViewDesc = null;
  private renderRef: null | JSX.Element = null;

  updateEffect() {
    const { view, decorations, siblingsRef, parentRef, getPos, node } =
      this.props;
    // There simply is no other way to ref a text node
    // eslint-disable-next-line react/no-find-dom-node
    const dom = findDOMNode(this);

    let textNode = dom;
    while (textNode.firstChild) {
      textNode = textNode.firstChild as Element | Text;
    }

    // We construct a view descriptor tree to integrate with ProseMirror.
    // This is essentially ProseMirror's virtual DOM implementation. It
    // needs to contain references to each node that it's responsible for,
    // just like the React virtual DOM.
    if (!this.viewDescRef) {
      this.viewDescRef = new TextViewDesc(
        undefined,
        [],
        () => getPos.current(),
        node,
        decorations,
        DecorationSet.empty,
        dom,
        textNode
      );
    } else {
      this.viewDescRef.parent = parentRef.current;
      this.viewDescRef.children = [];
      this.viewDescRef.node = node;
      this.viewDescRef.getPos = () => getPos.current();
      this.viewDescRef.outerDeco = decorations;
      this.viewDescRef.innerDeco = DecorationSet.empty;
      this.viewDescRef.dom = dom;
      // @ts-expect-error We have our own ViewDesc implementations
      this.viewDescRef.dom.pmViewDesc = this.viewDescRef;
      this.viewDescRef.nodeDOM = textNode;
    }

    if (!siblingsRef.current.includes(this.viewDescRef)) {
      siblingsRef.current.push(this.viewDescRef);
    }

    siblingsRef.current.sort(sortViewDescs);
  }

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps: Props): boolean {
    return !shallowEqual(this.props, nextProps);
  }

  componentDidMount(): void {
    this.updateEffect();
  }

  componentDidUpdate(): void {
    this.updateEffect();
  }

  componentWillUnmount(): void {
    const { siblingsRef } = this.props;
    if (!this.viewDescRef) return;
    if (siblingsRef.current.includes(this.viewDescRef)) {
      const index = siblingsRef.current.indexOf(this.viewDescRef);
      siblingsRef.current.splice(index, 1);
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { node, decorations } = this.props;

    // This may wrap the text in, e.g., a span,
    // but usually returns a string
    return decorations.reduce(
      wrapInDeco,
      node.text
    );
  }
}
```

### Bug: [react-hooks/rules-of-hooks] False positive if a loop exists anywhere in the component

> Issue #31831 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31831)

<!--
  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include
  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant
  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.
-->

~React~ `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` version: 5.1.0

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Use a React hook (e.g. `useRef`) in a component function.
1. Also include a `for` loop in a component function, that the hook is not a part of.
2. The hook value will be flagged by the eslint rule, e.g.: "React Hook "useRef" may be executed more than once. Possibly because it is called in a loop. React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component."

<!--
  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't
  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or
  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.
-->

Link to code example:

```ts
export default function Test() {
  const myRef = useRef(1);

  for (let i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log('test');
  }

  return myRef.current;
}
```


## The current behavior

The `useRef` call will be flagged by the rules-of-hooks plugin, since v5.1.0.

## The expected behavior

The `useRef` call will not be flagged, because it clearly is not called in a loop. This was the behavior as of v5.0.0.

### Bug: Uncaught ReferenceError: MessageChannel is not defined

> Issue #31827 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31827)

React version: 19.0.0

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Create an Astro & React project with server adapter for Cloudflare
2. Try to deploy to Cloudflare Pages via `wrangler deploy`

## The current behavior
Uncaught ReferenceError: MessageChannel is not defined

## The expected behavior
Should work in the same way as latest 18 version.
