### Repro steps

Greetings,
I am trying to get the component tree ( that react dev-tools show in the extension ) in my own code, and I want to send it to backend API server using an HTTP POST request.
Any idea on how I can achieve this?
I looked at using `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` but no luck yet.

Thank you
