## Description

## Summary
Please I have a question. I am using React 19 canary version. It keeps asking that I should declare react at the top of the file and I know that was removed in v18 or so. Is it now a requirement or a bug?

Precisely the error says `'React' refers to a UMD global, but the current file is a module. Consider adding an import instead.ts(2686)`
