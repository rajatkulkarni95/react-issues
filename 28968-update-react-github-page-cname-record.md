## Description

React GitHub page (https://facebook.github.io/react) (`gh-pages` branch) currently pointing to [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org) and then it redirects to https://react.dev/.

So many redirects, can we update the content of `CNAME` file with `react.dev`, if it ok to do, then I am very happy to do the same and I'll contribution in real open source project.
